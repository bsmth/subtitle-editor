00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:07,476
SAGAN: All my life I've wondered
about life beyond the Earth.

2
00:01:07,684 --> 00:01:11,677
On those countless other planets
that we think circle other suns...

3
00:01:11,888 --> 00:01:13,753
...is there also life?

4
00:01:13,957 --> 00:01:16,517
Might the beings of other
worlds resemble us...

5
00:01:16,726 --> 00:01:19,388
...or would they be
astonishingly different?

6
00:01:19,596 --> 00:01:21,962
What would they be made of?

7
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,326
In the vast Milky Way galaxy...

8
00:01:24,534 --> 00:01:27,935
...how common is what we call life?

9
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:31,439
The nature of life on Earth...

10
00:01:31,641 --> 00:01:33,404
...and the quest for life elsewhere...

11
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,738
...are the two sides
of the same question.

12
00:01:36,947 --> 00:01:39,711
The search for who we are.

13
00:01:44,788 --> 00:01:48,280
All living things on Earth
are made of organic molecules...

14
00:01:48,491 --> 00:01:51,016
...a complex microscopic
architecture...

15
00:01:51,228 --> 00:01:53,958
...built around atoms of carbon.

16
00:01:54,164 --> 00:01:56,223
In the great dark between the stars...

17
00:01:56,433 --> 00:01:59,368
...there also are organic molecules...

18
00:01:59,569 --> 00:02:03,403
...in immense clouds of gas and dust.

19
00:02:06,776 --> 00:02:08,403
Inside such clouds...

20
00:02:08,612 --> 00:02:12,104
...there are batches
of new worlds just forming.

21
00:02:12,315 --> 00:02:16,251
Their surfaces are very likely
covered with organic molecules.

22
00:02:16,453 --> 00:02:19,547
These molecules almost certainly
are not made by life...

23
00:02:19,756 --> 00:02:22,350
...although they
are the stuff of life.

24
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,653
On suitable worlds,
they may lead to life.

25
00:02:25,862 --> 00:02:29,389
Organic matter is abundant
throughout the cosmos...

26
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,365
...produced by the same chemistry
everywhere.

27
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:50,408
Perhaps, given enough time...

28
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:55,421
...the origin and evolution of life
is inevitable on every clement world.

29
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:59,356
There will surely be some planets
too hostile for life.

30
00:02:59,562 --> 00:03:02,258
On others,
it may arise and die out...

31
00:03:02,465 --> 00:03:05,491
...or never evolve
beyond its simplest forms.

32
00:03:05,702 --> 00:03:08,102
And on some small
fraction of worlds...

33
00:03:08,305 --> 00:03:11,604
...there may develop intelligences
and civilizations...

34
00:03:11,808 --> 00:03:14,140
...more advanced than ours.

35
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:20,349
All life on our planet
is closely related.

36
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:24,919
We have a common organic chemistry
and a common evolutionary heritage.

37
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:28,818
And so our biologists
are profoundly limited.

38
00:03:29,025 --> 00:03:31,289
They study a single biology...

39
00:03:31,494 --> 00:03:35,658
...one lonely theme
in the music of life.

40
00:03:35,865 --> 00:03:39,562
Is it the only voice
for thousands of light years...

41
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:44,468
...or is there a cosmic fugue,
a billion different voices...

42
00:03:44,674 --> 00:03:48,610
...playing the life music
of the galaxy?

43
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:55,984
This blue world is where we grew up.

44
00:03:56,186 --> 00:03:58,279
There was once a time before life.

45
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:01,651
Our planet is now
burgeoning with life.

46
00:04:01,858 --> 00:04:03,723
How did it come about?

47
00:04:03,927 --> 00:04:07,385
How were organic molecules
originally made?

48
00:04:07,597 --> 00:04:09,861
How did life evolve
to produce beings...

49
00:04:10,066 --> 00:04:12,967
...as elaborate and complex as we...

50
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:17,401
...able to explore the mystery
of our own origins?

51
00:04:20,643 --> 00:04:24,170
Let me tell you a story
about one little phrase...

52
00:04:24,381 --> 00:04:26,315
...in the music of life on Earth.

(WIND BLOWS)

54
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,665
In the history of humans...

55
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,734
...in the 12th century...

56
00:04:47,937 --> 00:04:52,533
...Japan was ruled by a clan
of warriors called the Heike.

57
00:05:02,185 --> 00:05:05,780
The nominal leader of the Heike,
the emperor of Japan...

58
00:05:05,989 --> 00:05:09,186
...was a 7-year-old boy
named Antoku.

59
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:13,692
His guardian was his grandmother,
the Lady Nii.

(DRUM BEATS)

61
00:05:22,772 --> 00:05:26,003
The Heike were engaged
in a long and bloody war...

62
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:29,576
...with another Samurai clan,
the Genji.

63
00:05:34,818 --> 00:05:38,151
Each asserted
a superior ancestral claim...

64
00:05:38,354 --> 00:05:40,219
...to the imperial throne.

65
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,220
(BATTLE CRIES)

66
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:46,726
Their decisive encounter
occurred at Dannoura...

67
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,491
...in the Japanese Inland Sea
on April 24...

68
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,635
...in the year 1 185.

69
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:59,131
The Heike were badly outnumbered
and outmaneuvered.

70
00:05:59,576 --> 00:06:01,510
With their cause clearly lost...

71
00:06:01,711 --> 00:06:06,648
...the surviving Heike warriors threw
themselves into the sea and drowned.

72
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:15,323
The emperor's grandmother,
the Lady Nii...

73
00:06:15,525 --> 00:06:18,255
...resolved that they would not
be captured by the enemy.

74
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:22,864
What happened next is related
in "The Tale of the Heike":

75
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,158
"The young emperor asked the Lady Nii,
'Where are you to take me?'

76
00:06:28,037 --> 00:06:32,736
She turned to the youthful sovereign
with tears streaming down her cheeks...

77
00:06:32,942 --> 00:06:34,341
...and comforted him.

78
00:06:37,347 --> 00:06:39,406
(WATER LAPS)

79
00:06:46,723 --> 00:06:48,350

80
00:06:48,558 --> 00:06:52,927
...the child sovereign put his
beautiful small hands together.

81
00:06:55,265 --> 00:06:57,165
He turned first to the east...

82
00:06:57,367 --> 00:07:00,530
...to say farewell
to the god of Ise...

83
00:07:00,737 --> 00:07:02,261
...and then to the west...

84
00:07:02,472 --> 00:07:06,135
...to recite a prayer
to the Amida Buddha.

The Lady Nii...

86
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:11,804

'In the depths of the ocean
is our capital'...

88
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:18,415
...sank with him at last
beneath the waves."

89
00:07:39,842 --> 00:07:43,642
The destruction of the Heike
battle fleet at Dannoura...

90
00:07:43,846 --> 00:07:46,644
...marked the end of the clan's
30-year rule.

91
00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:50,114
The Heike all but vanished
from history.

92

Only 43 Heike survived, all women.

93

These former ladies-in-waiting
of the Imperial Court...

94
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:05,689
...were reduced to selling flowers
and other favors...

95

...to the fishermen near
the scene of the battle.

96
00:08:15,445 --> 00:08:18,642
These women and their offspring
by the fishermen...

97
00:08:18,848 --> 00:08:22,181
...established a festival
to commemorate the battle.

98
00:08:28,825 --> 00:08:32,488
To this day, every year,
on the 24th of April...

99
00:08:32,695 --> 00:08:35,596
...their descendants proceed
to the Akama shrine...

100
00:08:35,798 --> 00:08:37,493
...which contains the mausoleum...

101
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,761
...of the drowned
7-year-old emperor, Antoku.

102
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:48,503
There, they conduct a ceremony
of remembrance...

103
00:08:48,711 --> 00:08:52,670
...for the life and death
of the Heike warriors.

104
00:09:01,057 --> 00:09:04,026
But there is a strange
postscript to this story:

105
00:09:04,227 --> 00:09:05,785
The fishermen say...

106
00:09:05,995 --> 00:09:10,728
...that the Heike samurai
wander the bottom of the Inland Sea...

107
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:13,663
...in the form of crabs.

108
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:18,763
There are crabs here which have
curious markings on their backs.

109
00:09:19,042 --> 00:09:22,034
Patterns which resemble
a human face...

110
00:09:22,245 --> 00:09:25,214
...with the aggressive scowl
of a samurai warrior...

111
00:09:25,415 --> 00:09:27,508
...from medieval Japan.

112
00:09:27,717 --> 00:09:30,379
(DRUM BEATS)

113
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:38,285
These Heike crabs, when caught,
are not eaten.

114
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:40,962
They are thrown back into the sea...

115
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,894
...in commemoration
of the doleful events...

116
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,069
...of the battle of Dannoura.

117
00:09:58,214 --> 00:10:01,411
This legend raises a lovely problem:

118
00:10:01,617 --> 00:10:05,451
How does it come about that the face
of a warrior...

119
00:10:05,655 --> 00:10:10,422
...is cut on the carapace of
a Japanese crab? How could it be?

120
00:10:10,626 --> 00:10:15,188
The answer seems to be
that humans made this face.

121
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:16,998
But how?

122
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,465
Like many other features,
the patterns on the back...

123
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:24,037
...or carapace of this crab
are inherited.

124
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,643
But among crabs, as among humans,
there are different hereditary lines.

125
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:32,104
Now, suppose purely by chance...

126
00:10:32,315 --> 00:10:35,546
...among the distant ancestors
of this crab...

127
00:10:35,752 --> 00:10:40,485
...there came to be one which looked
just a little bit like a human face.

128
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:44,182
Long before the battle, fishermen
may have been reluctant...

129
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,418
...to eat a crab with a human face.

130
00:10:46,763 --> 00:10:49,129
In throwing it back into the sea...

131
00:10:49,332 --> 00:10:53,462
...they were setting into motion
a process of selection.

132
00:10:53,669 --> 00:10:58,197
If you're a crab and your carapace
is just ordinary...

133
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,705
...the humans are gonna eat you.

134
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,470
But if it looks a little bit
like a face...

135
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:07,171
...they'll throw you back and you
can have lots of baby crabs...

136
00:11:07,383 --> 00:11:09,146
...that all look just like you.

137
00:11:09,352 --> 00:11:11,445
As many generations passed...

138
00:11:11,654 --> 00:11:14,521
...of crabs and fisher-folk alike...

139
00:11:14,724 --> 00:11:18,592
...the crabs with patterns that
looked most like a samurai face...

140
00:11:18,795 --> 00:11:20,990
...preferentially survived.

141
00:11:21,197 --> 00:11:24,758
Until eventually, there was produced
not just a human face...

142
00:11:24,967 --> 00:11:27,435
...not just a Japanese face...

143
00:11:27,637 --> 00:11:30,572
...but the face of a samurai warrior.

144
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:34,732
All this has nothing to do
with what the crabs might want.

145
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:38,380
Selection is imposed from the outside.

146
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:42,517
The more you look like a samurai,
the better your chances of survival.

147
00:11:42,718 --> 00:11:47,382
Eventually, there are a lot of crabs
that look like samurai warriors.

148
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:50,616
(DRUM BEATS)

149
00:12:08,711 --> 00:12:12,272
This process is called
artificial selection.

150
00:12:13,015 --> 00:12:15,313
In the case of the Heike crab,
it was effected...

151
00:12:15,518 --> 00:12:18,385
...more or less unconsciously
by the fishermen...

152
00:12:18,588 --> 00:12:22,854
...and certainly without any serious
contemplation by the crabs.

153
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:25,619
Humans, for thousands of years...

154
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,693
...have deliberately selected...

155
00:12:27,897 --> 00:12:30,559
...which plants
and animals shall live.

156
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,258
We're surrounded
by farm and domestic animals...

157
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,767
...fruits, vegetables.

158
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,268
Where do they come from? Were they
once free-living in the wild...

159
00:12:40,476 --> 00:12:44,310
...and then induced to adopt some
less strenuous life on the farm?

160
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,769
No.

161
00:12:45,982 --> 00:12:50,043
They are, almost all of them,
made by us.

162
00:12:53,756 --> 00:12:58,284
The essence of artificial selection
for a horse or a cow...

163
00:12:58,494 --> 00:13:01,827
...a grain of rice
or a Heike crab, is this:

164
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:05,330
Many characteristics are inherited.
They breed true.

165
00:13:07,303 --> 00:13:10,898
Humans encourage the reproduction
of some varieties...

166
00:13:11,107 --> 00:13:13,041
...and discourage
the reproduction of others.

167
00:13:13,242 --> 00:13:16,678
The variety selected for,
eventually becomes abundant.

168
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:20,838
The variety selected against,
becomes rare, maybe extinct.

169
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:25,214
But if artificial selection
makes such changes...

170
00:13:25,421 --> 00:13:27,480
...in only a few thousand years...

171
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,715
...what must natural selection...

172
00:13:29,926 --> 00:13:33,919
...working for billions of years,
be capable of?

173
00:13:34,163 --> 00:13:35,221
The answer...

174
00:13:35,431 --> 00:13:39,231
...is all the beauty and diversity
in the biological world.

175
00:13:43,973 --> 00:13:48,034
That life evolved over
the ages is clear...

176
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:51,873
...from the changes we've made
in the beasts and vegetables...

177
00:13:52,214 --> 00:13:55,775
...but also from
the record in the rocks.

178
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,849
The fossil evidence speaks
to us unambiguously...

179
00:13:59,055 --> 00:14:03,549
...of creatures that were once
present in enormous numbers...

180
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,784
...and that have now vanished utterly.

181
00:14:05,995 --> 00:14:09,487
There are more species that have
become extinct than exist today.

182
00:14:09,699 --> 00:14:13,795
They are the terminated
experiments in evolution.

183
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:19,466
These guys, the trilobites,
appeared 600 million years ago.

184
00:14:19,675 --> 00:14:22,303
They were around
for 300 million years.

185
00:14:22,511 --> 00:14:25,776
They're all gone. There's none left.

186
00:14:26,082 --> 00:14:30,712
But in those old rocks, there are
no fossils of people or cattle.

187
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,751
We've evolved only recently.

188
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:37,187
Evolution is a fact, not a theory.

189
00:14:37,393 --> 00:14:39,327
It really happened.

190
00:14:40,896 --> 00:14:42,864
(BEE BUZZES)

191
00:14:45,267 --> 00:14:49,499
That the mechanism of evolution is
natural selection was the discovery...

192
00:14:49,705 --> 00:14:53,141
...of Charles Darwin
and Alfred Russel Wallace.

193
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,037
Here's how it works:

194
00:14:55,544 --> 00:14:57,068
Nature is prolific.

195
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,147
There are many more creatures that
are born than can possibly survive.

196
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:06,287
So those varieties which are,
by accident, less well adapted...

197
00:15:06,522 --> 00:15:10,014
...don't survive, or at least
they leave fewer offspring.

198
00:15:10,226 --> 00:15:14,686
Now, mutations, sudden
changes in heredity...

199
00:15:14,897 --> 00:15:16,956
...are passed on. They breed true.

200
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:22,103
The environment selects the occasional
mutations which enhance survival.

201
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:26,775
The resulting series of slow changes
in the nature of living beings...

202
00:15:26,976 --> 00:15:29,103
...is the origin of new species.

203
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:34,046
Many people were scandalized...

204
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,445
...by the ideas of evolution
and natural selection.

205
00:15:36,652 --> 00:15:38,779
Our ancestors looked at...

206
00:15:38,988 --> 00:15:41,786
...the intricacy
and the beauty of life...

207
00:15:41,991 --> 00:15:45,791
...and saw evidence
for a great designer.

208
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:52,189
The simplest organism
is a far more complex machine...

209
00:15:52,401 --> 00:15:54,562
...than the finest pocket watch.

210
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:59,070
And yet, pocket watches don't
spontaneously self-assemble...

211
00:15:59,275 --> 00:16:02,574
...or evolve in slow
stages on their own...

212
00:16:02,778 --> 00:16:05,576
...from say, grandfather clocks.

213
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:08,816
A watch implies a watchmaker.

214
00:16:10,453 --> 00:16:14,947
There seemed to be no way atoms
could spontaneously fall together...

215
00:16:15,157 --> 00:16:17,591
...and create, say...

216
00:16:19,295 --> 00:16:20,455
...a dandelion.

217
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:23,428
The idea of a designer...

218
00:16:23,632 --> 00:16:28,296
...is an appealing and altogether human
explanation of the biological world.

219
00:16:28,504 --> 00:16:31,735
But as Darwin and Wallace showed...

220
00:16:31,941 --> 00:16:33,602
...there's another way...

221
00:16:33,809 --> 00:16:37,540
...equally human
and far more compelling.

222
00:16:37,947 --> 00:16:42,077
Natural selection, which makes
the music of life more beautiful...

223
00:16:42,284 --> 00:16:44,479
...as the eons pass.

224
00:16:48,157 --> 00:16:50,284
(LOUD RUMBLE)

225
00:16:50,526 --> 00:16:52,721
To understand the passage
of the eons...

226
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:56,261
...we have compressed all of time
into a single cosmic year...

227
00:16:56,465 --> 00:16:59,798
...with the big bang on January first.

228
00:17:00,002 --> 00:17:04,439
Every month here represents
a little over a billion years.

229
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,508
The Earth didn't form until
the cosmic year was two-thirds over.

230
00:17:08,711 --> 00:17:12,875
Our understanding of the history
of life is very recent...

231
00:17:13,082 --> 00:17:16,518
...occupying only the last few
seconds of December 31...

232
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:20,849
...that small white spot at bottom
right in the cosmic calendar.

233
00:17:21,056 --> 00:17:23,456
What happened on Earth may be
more or less typical...

234
00:17:23,659 --> 00:17:26,127
...of the evolution of life
on many worlds.

235
00:17:26,328 --> 00:17:28,319
But in its details...

236
00:17:28,531 --> 00:17:30,726
...the story of life on Earth...

237
00:17:30,933 --> 00:17:33,731
...is probably unique
in all the Milky Way galaxy.

238
00:17:34,403 --> 00:17:38,840
The secrets of evolution
are time and death.

239
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:42,875
Time for the slow accumulation
of favorable mutations...

240
00:17:43,078 --> 00:17:46,673
...and death to make room
for new species.

241
00:17:47,383 --> 00:17:50,648
Life on Earth arose in September
of the cosmic calendar...

242
00:17:50,853 --> 00:17:55,517
...when our world, still battered and
cratered from its violent origin...

243
00:17:55,724 --> 00:17:57,885
...may have looked
a little like the moon.

244
00:18:00,062 --> 00:18:03,589
The Earth is about four and a half
billion years old.

245
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:05,130
In the cosmic calendar...

246
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:09,327
...it condensed out of interstellar
gas and dust...

247
00:18:09,538 --> 00:18:12,166
...around September 1 4.

248
00:18:12,374 --> 00:18:16,037
We know from the fossil record
that life originated soon after...

249
00:18:16,245 --> 00:18:19,510
...maybe around September 25,
something like that...

250
00:18:19,715 --> 00:18:23,583
...probably in the ponds and oceans
of the primitive Earth.

251
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:28,415
The first living things were not
as complex as a one-celled organism...

252
00:18:28,624 --> 00:18:32,253
...which is already a highly
sophisticated form of life.

253
00:18:32,461 --> 00:18:36,488
No, the first stirrings
of life were much more humble...

254
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:39,532
...and happened on the molecular level.

255
00:18:39,735 --> 00:18:43,933
In those early days, lightning
and ultraviolet light from the sun...

256
00:18:44,139 --> 00:18:48,337
...were breaking apart hydrogen-rich
molecules in the atmosphere.

257
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:53,038
The fragments of the molecules
were spontaneously recombining...

258
00:18:53,249 --> 00:18:57,049
...into more and more
complex molecules.

259
00:18:59,188 --> 00:19:03,147
The products of this early
chemistry dissolved in the oceans...

260
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:06,658
...forming a kind of organic soup...

261
00:19:06,862 --> 00:19:08,989
...of gradually increasing complexity.

262
00:19:09,198 --> 00:19:12,998
Until one day, quite by accident...

263
00:19:13,202 --> 00:19:17,298
...a molecule arose that was able
to make crude copies of itself...

264
00:19:17,506 --> 00:19:20,942
...using as building blocks
the other molecules in the soup.

265
00:19:21,143 --> 00:19:24,601
This was the ancestor of DNA...

266
00:19:24,813 --> 00:19:28,180
...the master molecule
of life on Earth.

267
00:19:28,384 --> 00:19:32,047
It's made of four different
parts, called nucleotides...

268
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:35,951
...which constitute the four letters
of the genetic code...

269
00:19:36,158 --> 00:19:37,716
...the language of heredity.

270
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:42,795
Each of the nucleotides,
the rungs on the DNA ladder...

271
00:19:42,998 --> 00:19:45,296
...are a different color
in this model.

272
00:19:45,501 --> 00:19:48,766
The instructions are different
for different organisms.

273
00:19:48,971 --> 00:19:51,337
That's why organisms
are different.

274
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:55,374
Now, a mutation is a change
of a nucleotide...

275
00:19:55,577 --> 00:19:58,603
...a misspelling
of the genetic instructions.

276
00:19:58,814 --> 00:20:03,683
Most mutations spell genetic
nonsense since they're random.

277
00:20:03,886 --> 00:20:06,081
They harm the next generation.

278
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,586
But a very few, by accident...

279
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:13,285
...make better sense than the
original codes, and aid evolution.

280
00:20:13,996 --> 00:20:17,295
DNA is about a billion
times smaller...

281
00:20:17,499 --> 00:20:19,228
...than we see it here.

282
00:20:19,435 --> 00:20:24,372
Each of those things that looks
like a piece of fruit is an atom.

283
00:20:24,573 --> 00:20:26,165
Without the tools of science...

284
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:29,674
...the machinery of life
would be invisible.

285
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,543
Four billion years ago...

286
00:20:35,751 --> 00:20:39,778
...the ancestors of DNA competed
for molecular building blocks...

287
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:42,957
...and left crude copies
of themselves.

288
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:46,423
There were no predators;
the stuff of life was everywhere.

289
00:20:46,628 --> 00:20:49,995
The oceans and murky pools
that filled the craters...

290
00:20:50,199 --> 00:20:53,498
...were, for these molecules,
a Garden of Eden.

291
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:56,828
With reproduction, mutation
and natural selection...

292
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:01,066
...the evolution of living
molecules was well underway.

293
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:05,512
Varieties with specialized
functions joined together...

294
00:21:05,714 --> 00:21:08,740
...making a collective.
The first cell.

295
00:21:08,951 --> 00:21:12,011
The organic soup eventually
ate itself up.

296
00:21:12,221 --> 00:21:15,588
But by this time, plants had evolved,
able to use sunlight...

297
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:20,524
...to make their own building blocks.
They turned the waters green.

298
00:21:20,729 --> 00:21:22,924
One-celled plants
joined together:

299
00:21:23,132 --> 00:21:26,158
The first multi-cellular organisms.

300
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:32,106
Equally important was the invention,
not made until early November...

301
00:21:32,307 --> 00:21:36,801
...of sex. It was stumbled upon
by the microbes.

302
00:21:39,481 --> 00:21:43,144
By December 1, green plants
had released copious amounts...

303
00:21:43,352 --> 00:21:46,583
...of oxygen and nitrogen
into the atmosphere.

304
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:50,088
The sky is made by life.

305
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:54,123
Then, suddenly, on December 1 5...

306
00:21:54,329 --> 00:21:57,321
...there was an enormous proliferation
of new life forms...

307
00:21:57,533 --> 00:22:00,969
...an event called
the "Cambrian Explosion."

308
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:10,402
We know from fossils that life arose
shortly after the Earth formed...

309
00:22:10,612 --> 00:22:14,343
...suggesting that the origin
of life might be...

310
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:18,748
...an inevitable chemical process
on countless Earth-like planets...

311
00:22:18,954 --> 00:22:20,546
...throughout the cosmos.

312
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:25,557
But on the Earth, in nearly 4 billion
years, life advanced no further...

313
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:26,728
...than algae.

314
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:31,730
So maybe more complex forms of life
are harder to evolve...

315
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:34,494
...harder even than the origin
of life itself.

316
00:22:34,703 --> 00:22:37,365
If this is right, the planets
of the galaxy...

317
00:22:37,573 --> 00:22:40,235
...might be filled
with microorganisms...

318
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:44,310
...but big beasts and vegetables
and thinking beings...

319
00:22:44,513 --> 00:22:47,311
...might be comparatively rare.

320
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:54,847
By December 18, there were vast
herds of trilobites...

321
00:22:55,057 --> 00:22:57,184
...foraging on the ocean bottom...

322
00:22:57,392 --> 00:23:00,828
...and squid-like creatures with
multicolored shells...

323
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:02,496
...were everywhere.

324
00:23:05,434 --> 00:23:09,029
We know enough to sketch in a few
of the subsequent details.

325
00:23:09,238 --> 00:23:12,935
The first fish and the first
vertebrates appeared on December 19.

326
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:16,702
Plants began to colonize the land
on December 20.

327
00:23:16,912 --> 00:23:21,008
The first winged insects fluttered by
on December 22.

328
00:23:21,216 --> 00:23:24,344
On this date also, there were
the first amphibians...

329
00:23:24,553 --> 00:23:26,987
...creatures something
like the lungfish...

330
00:23:27,189 --> 00:23:30,454
...able to survive both on land
and in water.

331
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:34,891
Our direct ancestors were now
leaving the oceans behind.

332
00:23:37,766 --> 00:23:42,703
The first trees and the first reptiles
evolved on December 23:

333
00:23:42,938 --> 00:23:46,203
Two amazing evolutionary developments.

334
00:23:48,544 --> 00:23:51,980
We are descended
from some of those reptiles.

335
00:23:56,385 --> 00:23:59,718
The dinosaurs appeared
on Christmas Eve.

336
00:23:59,922 --> 00:24:01,981
There were many different
kinds of dinosaurs.

337
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:05,159
The Earth was once their planet.

338
00:24:08,297 --> 00:24:11,733
Many stood upright and had
some fair intelligence.

339
00:24:11,934 --> 00:24:16,769
Great lizards crashed and thundered
through the steaming jungles.

340
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:24,505
Unnoticed by the dinosaurs,
a new creature...

341
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,874
...whose young were born live
and helpless...

342
00:24:27,082 --> 00:24:29,414
...was making its timid debut.

343
00:24:29,618 --> 00:24:32,746
The first mammals emerged
on December 26...

344
00:24:32,955 --> 00:24:36,220
...the first birds
on the following day.

345
00:24:39,528 --> 00:24:42,929
But the dinosaurs still
dominated the planet.

346
00:24:43,131 --> 00:24:47,067
Then suddenly, without warning,
all over the planet at once...

347
00:24:47,269 --> 00:24:49,032
...the dinosaurs died.

348
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:52,604
The cause is unknown,
but the lesson is clear:

349
00:24:52,808 --> 00:24:57,507
Even 160 million years on a planet
is no guarantee of survival.

350
00:24:57,713 --> 00:25:02,207
The dinosaurs perished
around the time of the first flower.

351
00:25:04,052 --> 00:25:06,179
On December 30, the first creatures...

352
00:25:06,388 --> 00:25:09,221
...who looked even a little bit human,
evolved...

353
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:13,588
...accompanied by a spectacular increase
in the size of their brains.

354
00:25:13,795 --> 00:25:17,663
And then, on the evening
of the last day of the last month...

355
00:25:17,866 --> 00:25:19,493
...only a few million years ago...

356
00:25:19,701 --> 00:25:24,536
...the first true humans took
their place on the cosmic calendar.

357
00:25:25,841 --> 00:25:27,638
The written record of history...

358
00:25:27,843 --> 00:25:31,506
...occupies only the last 10 seconds
of the cosmic year.

359
00:25:34,016 --> 00:25:37,918
Now, let's take a closer look
at who our ancestors were.

360
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,180
A simple chemical circumstance
led to a great moment...

361
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:43,415
...in the history of our planet.

362
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:46,560
There were many molecules
in the primordial soup.

363
00:25:46,762 --> 00:25:51,597
Some were attracted to water on one
side and repelled by it on the other.

364
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,394
This drove them together...

365
00:25:54,603 --> 00:25:57,401
...into a tiny enclosed
spherical shell...

366
00:25:57,606 --> 00:26:00,404
...like a soap bubble,
which protected the interior.

367
00:26:00,609 --> 00:26:04,170
Within the bubble,
the ancestors of DNA found a home...

368
00:26:04,379 --> 00:26:06,074
...and the first cell arose.

369
00:26:06,281 --> 00:26:10,274
It took hundreds of millions of years
for tiny plants to evolve...

370
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:11,952
...giving off oxygen.

371
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:15,385
But that branch didn't lead to us.

372
00:26:15,891 --> 00:26:20,726
Bacteria that could breathe oxygen
took over a billion years to evolve.

373
00:26:22,097 --> 00:26:26,431
From a naked nucleus, a cell
developed with a nucleus inside.

374
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:32,136
Some of these amoeba-like forms
led eventually to plants.

375
00:26:36,211 --> 00:26:38,145
Others produced colonies...

376
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:42,612
...with inside and outside cells
performing different functions.

377
00:26:44,453 --> 00:26:45,784
Becoming...

378
00:26:45,987 --> 00:26:49,650
...a polyp attached
to the ocean floor...

379
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:52,224
...filtering food from the water...

380
00:26:52,661 --> 00:26:55,186
...and evolving little tentacles...

381
00:26:55,397 --> 00:26:58,730
...to direct food
into a primitive mouth.

382
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:01,663
This humble ancestor of ours
also led...

383
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:06,034
...to spiny-skinned armored animals
with internal organs...

384
00:27:06,241 --> 00:27:10,109
...including our cousin, the starfish.

385
00:27:10,312 --> 00:27:12,746
But we don't come from starfish.

386
00:27:13,682 --> 00:27:15,946
About 550 million years ago...

387
00:27:16,151 --> 00:27:19,143
...filter feeders
evolved gill slits...

388
00:27:19,354 --> 00:27:22,653
...which were more efficient
at straining food particles.

389
00:27:22,858 --> 00:27:26,589
One evolutionary branch
led to acorn worms.

390
00:27:26,862 --> 00:27:31,390
Another led to a creature which
swam freely in the larval stage...

391
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,933
...but, as an adult, was still
firmly anchored to the ocean floor.

392
00:27:35,137 --> 00:27:37,799
Some became living hollow tubes.

393
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:42,674
But others retained the larval forms
throughout the life cycle...

394
00:27:42,878 --> 00:27:46,905
...and became free-swimming adults
with something like a backbone.

395
00:27:51,887 --> 00:27:53,445
Our ancestors now...

396
00:27:53,655 --> 00:27:57,989
...500 million years ago,
were jawless filter-feeding fish...

397
00:27:58,193 --> 00:28:00,627
...a little like lampreys.

398
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,660
Gradually, those tiny fish...

399
00:28:04,866 --> 00:28:07,528
...evolved eyes and jaws.

400
00:28:08,036 --> 00:28:10,197
Fish then began to eat one another...

401
00:28:10,405 --> 00:28:13,465
...if you could swim fast,
you survived.

402
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:20,079
If you had jaws to eat with, you could
use your gills to breathe in the water.

403
00:28:20,382 --> 00:28:23,283
This is the way modern fish arose.

404
00:28:27,556 --> 00:28:30,116
During the summer,
swamps and lakes dried up.

405
00:28:30,325 --> 00:28:35,126
Some fish evolved a primitive lung
to breathe air until the rains came.

406
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:37,628
Their brains were getting bigger.

407
00:28:37,833 --> 00:28:41,360
If the rains didn't come, it was handy
to be able to pull yourself...

408
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:42,832
...to the next swamp.

409
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:45,939
That was a very important adaptation.

410
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:52,913
The first amphibians evolved,
still with a fish-like tail.

411
00:28:53,114 --> 00:28:57,483
Amphibians, like fish, laid their eggs
in water where they were easily eaten.

412
00:28:57,686 --> 00:29:00,314
But then a splendid
new invention came along:

413
00:29:00,522 --> 00:29:05,118
The hard-shelled egg, laid on land
where there were as yet no predators.

414
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:09,889
Reptiles and turtles
go back to those days.

415
00:29:11,867 --> 00:29:15,200
Many of the reptiles hatched on land
never returned to the waters.

416
00:29:15,403 --> 00:29:17,928
Some became the dinosaurs.

417
00:29:18,306 --> 00:29:22,538
One line of dinosaurs developed
feathers, useful for short flights.

418
00:29:22,744 --> 00:29:27,613
Today, the only living descendants
of the dinosaurs are the birds.

419
00:29:29,317 --> 00:29:31,751
The great dinosaurs evolved
along another branch.

420
00:29:31,953 --> 00:29:34,979
Some were the largest flesh-eaters
ever to walk the land.

421
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:39,957
But 65 million years ago they all
mysteriously perished.

422
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,596
Meanwhile, the forerunners
of the dinosaurs...

423
00:29:43,798 --> 00:29:46,426
...were also evolving
in a different direction.

424
00:29:46,635 --> 00:29:49,365
Small, scurrying creatures...

425
00:29:49,571 --> 00:29:52,472
...with the young growing
inside the mother's body.

426
00:29:52,674 --> 00:29:57,077
After the extinction of the dinosaurs,
many different forms developed.

427
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:04,079
The young were very immature at birth.

428
00:30:04,286 --> 00:30:07,346
In the marsupials,
the wombat, for example...

429
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:11,150
...and in the mammals, the young had
to be taught how to survive.

430
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:13,554
The brain grew larger still.

431
00:30:13,762 --> 00:30:18,096
Something like a shrew was
the ancestor of all the mammals.

432
00:30:22,804 --> 00:30:26,638
One line took to the trees,
developing dexterity...

433
00:30:26,841 --> 00:30:28,809
...stereo vision, larger brains...

434
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:31,501
...and a curiosity
about their environment.

435
00:30:31,713 --> 00:30:36,548
Some became baboons,
but that's not the line to us.

436
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,911
Apes and humans have
a recent common ancestor.

437
00:30:41,122 --> 00:30:45,081
Bone for bone, muscle for muscle,
molecule for molecule.

438
00:30:45,293 --> 00:30:50,230
There are almost no important
differences between apes and humans.

439
00:30:53,201 --> 00:30:57,501
Unlike the chimpanzee,
our ancestors walked upright...

440
00:30:57,706 --> 00:31:01,733
...freeing their hands
to poke and fix and experiment.

441
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:05,401
We got smarter. We began to talk.

442
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,582
Many collateral branches
of the human family...

443
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:18,247
...became extinct in
the last few million years.

444
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:22,863
We, with our brains and our hands,
are the survivors.

445
00:31:23,064 --> 00:31:28,001
There's an unbroken thread that
stretches from those first cells to us.

446
00:31:28,336 --> 00:31:29,633
Let's look at it again...

447
00:31:29,838 --> 00:31:34,639
...compressing 4 billion years
of human evolution into 40 seconds.

448
00:32:20,722 --> 00:32:23,885
Those are some of the things
that molecules do...

449
00:32:24,092 --> 00:32:27,152
...given 4 billion years of evolution.

450
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:32,663
We sometimes represent evolution as
the ever-branching ramifications...

451
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,232
...of some original trunk...

452
00:32:34,436 --> 00:32:38,702
...each branch pruned and clipped
by natural selection.

453
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:41,509
Every plant and animal
alive today...

454
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:46,112
...has a history as ancient
and illustrious as ours.

455
00:32:46,314 --> 00:32:49,681
Humans stand on one branch.

456
00:32:50,118 --> 00:32:53,019
But now we affect
the future of every branch...

457
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:56,281
...of this 4-billion-year-old tree.

458
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:01,953
How lovely trees are.

459
00:33:02,163 --> 00:33:05,394
The human species grew up
in and around them.

460
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,535
We have a natural affinity for trees.

461
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:10,795
Trees photosynthesize...

462
00:33:11,005 --> 00:33:13,735
...they harvest sunlight...

463
00:33:13,942 --> 00:33:17,844
...they compete for the sun's favors.

464
00:33:18,713 --> 00:33:20,442
Look at those two trees there...

465
00:33:20,648 --> 00:33:23,845
...pushing and shoving for sunlight...

466
00:33:24,052 --> 00:33:28,648
...but with grace
and astonishing slowness.

467
00:33:36,331 --> 00:33:38,561
There are so many plants
on the Earth...

468
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:41,326
...that there's a danger
of thinking them trivial...

469
00:33:41,536 --> 00:33:45,666
...of losing sight of the subtlety
and efficiency of their design.

470
00:33:45,874 --> 00:33:50,436
They are great and beautiful
machines, powered by sunlight...

471
00:33:50,645 --> 00:33:54,479
...taking in water from the ground
and carbon dioxide from the air...

472
00:33:54,682 --> 00:33:59,278
...and converting them into food
for their use and ours.

473
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:11,190
This is a museum of living plants.

474
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:16,268
The Royal Botanic Gardens
at Kew in London.

475
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:24,945
Every plant uses
the carbohydrates it makes...

476
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:28,843
...as an energy source
to go about its planty business.

477
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:32,884
And we animals, who are ultimately
parasites on the plants...

478
00:34:33,087 --> 00:34:36,921
...we steal the carbohydrates
so we can go about our business.

479
00:34:42,263 --> 00:34:44,925
In eating the plants
and their fruits...

480
00:34:45,133 --> 00:34:48,102
...we combine the carbohydrates
with oxygen...

481
00:34:48,303 --> 00:34:51,534
...which as a result of breathing,
we've dissolved in our blood.

482
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:56,676
From this chemical reaction, we
extract the energy which makes us go.

483
00:34:57,111 --> 00:34:59,978
In the process,
we exhale carbon dioxide...

484
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:03,582
...which the plants then use
to make more carbohydrates.

485
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:08,383
What a marvelous
cooperative arrangement.

486
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:11,718
Plants and animals each using
the other's waste gases...

487
00:35:11,926 --> 00:35:16,522
...the whole cycle powered
by abundant sunlight.

488
00:35:16,931 --> 00:35:20,697
But there would be carbon dioxide in
the air even if there were no animals.

489
00:35:20,902 --> 00:35:24,497
We need the plants
much more than they need us.

490
00:35:28,643 --> 00:35:32,602
There are family resemblances
among the organisms of the Earth.

491
00:35:32,814 --> 00:35:37,217
Some are very apparent,
such as the use of the number five.

492
00:35:37,418 --> 00:35:40,285
Humans have five major
bodily projections:

493
00:35:40,488 --> 00:35:43,787
One head, two arms, two legs.

494
00:35:43,992 --> 00:35:45,459
So do ducks...

495
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:50,063
...although the functions of their
projections are not quite the same.

496
00:35:50,265 --> 00:35:53,757
An octopus or a centipede
has a different plan.

497
00:35:53,968 --> 00:35:58,667
And a being from another planet
might be much stranger still.

498
00:35:58,873 --> 00:36:03,742
These family resemblances continue
and on a much deeper level...

499
00:36:03,945 --> 00:36:06,880
...when we go to the
molecular basis of life.

500
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:09,777
There are tens of billions...

501
00:36:09,984 --> 00:36:12,885
...of different kinds
of organic molecules.

502
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:15,282
Yet only about 50 of them...

503
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:18,584
...are used in the essential
machinery of life.

504
00:36:18,793 --> 00:36:21,227
The same 50 employed
over and over again...

505
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:26,025
...ingenious, for different functions
in every living thing.

506
00:36:26,234 --> 00:36:28,998
And when we go to the very kernel
of life on Earth...

507
00:36:29,203 --> 00:36:32,661
...to the proteins that
control cell chemistry...

508
00:36:32,874 --> 00:36:36,776
...to the spiral or helix
of nucleic acids...

509
00:36:36,978 --> 00:36:39,572
...which carry
the hereditary information...

510
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:43,808
...we find these molecules
to be identical...

511
00:36:44,018 --> 00:36:47,613
...in all plants and animals
of our planet.

512
00:37:12,413 --> 00:37:17,009
This oak tree and me,
we're made of the same stuff.

513
00:37:17,218 --> 00:37:20,119
If you go back, you'll find
that we have a common ancestor.

514
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:23,552
That's why our chemistry is so alike.

515
00:37:26,594 --> 00:37:30,587
Let's take a trip to examine
this common basis of life.

516
00:37:30,798 --> 00:37:34,199
A voyage to investigate
the molecular machinery...

517
00:37:34,402 --> 00:37:36,529
...at the heart of life on Earth.

518
00:37:36,738 --> 00:37:40,299
A journey to the nucleus of the cell.

519
00:37:40,541 --> 00:37:42,065
First we need a cell.

520
00:37:42,643 --> 00:37:46,909
I have trillions.
I can afford to donate a few.

521
00:37:52,954 --> 00:37:55,684
The casual act of pricking a finger...

522
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:59,519
...is an event of some magnitude
on the scale of the very small.

523
00:37:59,727 --> 00:38:04,426
Millions of red blood cells are
detoured from their usual routes.

524
00:38:06,401 --> 00:38:09,234
But most continue
to cruise about the body...

525
00:38:09,437 --> 00:38:13,396
...carrying their cargoes of oxygen
to the remotest freckle.

526
00:38:14,509 --> 00:38:16,704
We're about to enter
the living cell...

527
00:38:16,911 --> 00:38:20,438
...a realm, in its own way,
as complex and beautiful...

528
00:38:20,648 --> 00:38:23,617
...as the realm of galaxies and stars.

529
00:38:24,018 --> 00:38:27,010
Among the red blood cells,
we encounter a white blood cell...

530
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:28,813
...a lymphocyte...

531
00:38:29,023 --> 00:38:31,992
...whose job it is to protect me
against invading microbes.

532
00:38:32,193 --> 00:38:35,128
It makes antibodies
on its furrowed surface...

533
00:38:35,329 --> 00:38:38,856
...but its interior is
like that of many cells.

534
00:38:40,802 --> 00:38:44,795
Plunging through the membrane,
we find ourselves inside the cell.

535
00:38:45,006 --> 00:38:48,669
Here, every structure
has its function.

536
00:38:51,512 --> 00:38:54,413
These dark green blobs
are factories...

537
00:38:54,615 --> 00:38:57,584
...where messenger molecules
are busy building the enzymes...

538
00:38:57,785 --> 00:39:00,083
...which control
the chemistry of the cell.

539
00:39:00,288 --> 00:39:03,382
The messengers were
instructed and dispatched...

540
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:07,687
...from within the nucleus,
the heart and brain of the cell.

541
00:39:08,029 --> 00:39:10,554
All the instructions on
how to get a cell to work...

542
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:13,666
...and how to make another
are hidden away in there.

543
00:39:13,868 --> 00:39:16,336
We find a tunnel, a nuclear pore...

544
00:39:16,537 --> 00:39:20,268
...an approach to
the biological holy of holies.

545
00:39:22,477 --> 00:39:27,414
These necklaces, these intricately
looped and coiled strands...

546
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:30,175
...are nucleic acids, DNA.

547
00:39:31,719 --> 00:39:34,279
Everything you need to know on
how to make a human being...

548
00:39:34,489 --> 00:39:39,426
...is encoded in the language
of life in the DNA molecule.

549
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:50,165
This is the DNA double helix...

550
00:39:50,371 --> 00:39:55,308
...a machine with about 100 billion
moving parts, called atoms.

551
00:39:56,244 --> 00:39:59,338
There are as many atoms
in one molecule of DNA...

552
00:39:59,547 --> 00:40:03,244
...as there are stars
in a typical galaxy.

553
00:40:07,588 --> 00:40:10,921
The sequence of nucleotides,
here brightly colored...

554
00:40:11,125 --> 00:40:14,117
...is all that's passed on
from generation to generation.

555
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:16,558
Change the order of the nucleotides...

556
00:40:16,764 --> 00:40:19,824
...and you change
the genetic instructions.

557
00:40:27,308 --> 00:40:31,335
DNA must replicate itself
with extreme fidelity.

558
00:40:31,546 --> 00:40:36,142
The reproduction of a DNA molecule
begins by separating the two helices.

559
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:40,309
This is accomplished
by an unwinding enzyme.

560
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:44,514
Like some precision tool,
this enzyme, shown in blue...

561
00:40:44,725 --> 00:40:49,662
...breaks the chemical bonds
that bind the two helices of DNA.

562
00:40:50,298 --> 00:40:52,892
The enzyme works its way
down the molecule...

563
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:56,365
...unzipping DNA as it goes.

564
00:40:58,973 --> 00:41:01,066
Each helix copies the other...

565
00:41:01,275 --> 00:41:04,472
...supervised by special enzymes.

566
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:08,513
The organic soup inside the nucleus
contains many free nucleotides.

567
00:41:08,783 --> 00:41:13,720
The enzyme recognizes an approaching
nucleotide and clicks it into place...

568
00:41:14,021 --> 00:41:17,286
...reproducing another rung
in the double helix.

569
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:24,190
When the DNA is replicating
in one of your cells...

570
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:27,265
...a few dozen nucleotides
are added every second.

571
00:41:27,602 --> 00:41:32,005
Thousands of these enzymes may be
working on a given DNA molecule.

572
00:41:41,849 --> 00:41:44,613
When an arriving nucleotide
doesn't fit...

573
00:41:44,819 --> 00:41:46,878
...the enzyme throws it away.

574
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:48,715
We call this proofreading.

575
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:51,414
On the rare occasions
of a proofreading error...

576
00:41:51,626 --> 00:41:53,560
...the wrong nucleotide is attached...

577
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:57,390
...and a small random change has
been made in the genetic instructions.

578
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:59,964
A mutation has occurred.

579
00:42:01,502 --> 00:42:04,266
This enzyme is a
pretty small molecule...

580
00:42:04,472 --> 00:42:07,464
...but it catches nucleotides,
assembles them in the right order...

581
00:42:07,675 --> 00:42:09,108
...it knows how to proofread...

582
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:12,177
...it's responsible
in the most fundamental way...

583
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:16,874
...for the reproduction of every cell
and every being on Earth.

584
00:42:22,323 --> 00:42:24,814
That enzyme and DNA itself...

585
00:42:25,026 --> 00:42:28,962
...are molecular machines
with awesome powers.

586
00:42:31,666 --> 00:42:35,227
Within every living thing,
the molecular machines are busy...

587
00:42:35,436 --> 00:42:40,032
...making sure that nucleic acids
will continue to reproduce.

588
00:43:00,961 --> 00:43:04,419
A minor cut in my skin
sounds a local alarm...

589
00:43:04,632 --> 00:43:08,500
...and the blood spins
a complex net of strong fibers...

590
00:43:08,703 --> 00:43:11,866
...to form a clot
and staunch the flow of blood.

591
00:43:12,073 --> 00:43:13,768
There's a very delicate balance here:

592
00:43:13,974 --> 00:43:17,102
Too much clotting
and your blood stream will solidify.

593
00:43:17,311 --> 00:43:21,441
Too little clotting and you'll bleed
to death from the merest scratch.

594
00:43:21,749 --> 00:43:26,686
The balance is controlled
by enzymes instructed by DNA.

595
00:43:29,323 --> 00:43:32,486
Down here, there's also
a kind of sanitation squad...

596
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:35,958
...comprised of white blood cells,
that swings into action...

597
00:43:36,163 --> 00:43:40,793
...surrounds invading bacteria
and ravenously consumes them.

598
00:43:41,001 --> 00:43:44,164
This mopping-up operation is
a part of the healing process...

599
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:47,363
...again controlled by DNA.

600
00:43:48,943 --> 00:43:53,073
These cells are parts of us,
but how alien they seem.

601
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,908
Within each of them,
within every cell...

602
00:43:56,117 --> 00:43:59,143
...there are exquisitely
evolved molecular machines.

603
00:43:59,353 --> 00:44:02,914
Nucleic acids, enzymes,
the cell architecture...

604
00:44:03,124 --> 00:44:06,992
...every cell is a triumph
of natural selection.

605
00:44:07,194 --> 00:44:10,391
And we're made of trillions of cells.

606
00:44:10,598 --> 00:44:13,590
We are, each of us, a multitude.

607
00:44:15,202 --> 00:44:18,262
Within us is a little universe.

608
00:44:34,522 --> 00:44:39,459
Human DNA is a coiled ladder...

609
00:44:39,693 --> 00:44:41,957
...a billion nucleotides long.

610
00:44:42,496 --> 00:44:46,830
Many possible combinations of
nucleotides are nonsense. That is...

611
00:44:47,034 --> 00:44:51,403
...they translate into proteins which
serve no useful function whatever.

612
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:54,836
Only a comparatively few
nucleic acid molecules...

613
00:44:55,042 --> 00:44:59,706
...are any good for life forms
as complicated as we are.

614
00:45:00,481 --> 00:45:04,679
But even so, the number of useful ways
of assembling nucleic acids...

615
00:45:04,885 --> 00:45:07,046
...is stupefyingly large.

616
00:45:07,254 --> 00:45:12,123
It's probably larger than the total
number of atoms in the universe.

617
00:45:12,326 --> 00:45:17,263
This means that the number of
possible kinds of human beings...

618
00:45:17,565 --> 00:45:22,195
...is vastly greater than the number
of human beings that has ever lived.

619
00:45:22,436 --> 00:45:26,668
This untapped potential of
the human species is immense.

620
00:45:26,874 --> 00:45:29,536
There are ways of
putting nucleic acids together...

621
00:45:29,743 --> 00:45:34,009
...which will function far better
by any criterion you wish to choose...

622
00:45:34,215 --> 00:45:39,152
...than the hereditary instructions of
any human being who has ever lived.

623
00:45:39,587 --> 00:45:44,047
Fortunately, we do not know,
or at least do not yet know...

624
00:45:44,258 --> 00:45:48,786
...how to assemble alternative
sequences of nucleotides...

625
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:52,363
...to make alternative kinds
of human beings.

626
00:45:52,566 --> 00:45:56,093
In the future, we might be able
to put nucleotides together...

627
00:45:56,303 --> 00:45:58,032
...in any desired sequence...

628
00:45:58,239 --> 00:46:01,640
...to produce human characteristics
we think desirable.

629
00:46:02,643 --> 00:46:06,602
A disquieting and awesome prospect.

630
00:46:17,391 --> 00:46:21,555
We human beings don't look
very much like a tree.

631
00:46:21,762 --> 00:46:25,789
We certainly view the world
differently than a tree does.

632
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,458
But down deep,
at the molecular heart of life...

633
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:32,833
...we're essentially
identical to trees.

634
00:46:33,407 --> 00:46:38,276
We both use nucleic acids
as the hereditary material.

635
00:46:38,479 --> 00:46:43,382
We both use proteins as enzymes
to control the chemistry of the cell.

636
00:46:44,752 --> 00:46:49,280
And most significantly,
we both use the identical code book...

637
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:54,393
...to translate nucleic acid information
into protein information.

638
00:46:54,595 --> 00:46:58,964
Any tree could read my genetic code.

639
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,425
How did such astonishing similarities
come about?

640
00:47:02,636 --> 00:47:06,766
Why are we cousins to the trees?

641
00:47:06,974 --> 00:47:10,102
Would life on some other planet
use proteins?

642
00:47:10,311 --> 00:47:15,248
The same proteins? The same nucleic
acids? The same genetic code?

643
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:18,783
The usual explanation
is that we are...

644
00:47:18,986 --> 00:47:22,547
...all of us, trees and people...

645
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:27,591
...anglerfish, slime molds,
bacteria...

646
00:47:27,795 --> 00:47:31,424
...all descended from a single
and common instance...

647
00:47:31,632 --> 00:47:34,499
...of the origin of life
4 billion years ago...

648
00:47:34,702 --> 00:47:36,863
...in the early days of our planet.

649
00:47:37,705 --> 00:47:39,502
Now, how...

650
00:47:39,707 --> 00:47:43,108
...did the molecules
of life arise?

651
00:47:44,678 --> 00:47:46,043
(THUNDER)

652
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:50,879
(LIGHTNING BUZZES)

653
00:48:01,462 --> 00:48:03,760
In a laboratory
at Cornell University...

654
00:48:04,198 --> 00:48:07,827
...we mix together the gases
and waters of the primitive Earth...

655
00:48:08,035 --> 00:48:09,468
...supply some energy...

656
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:13,265
...and see if we can make
the stuff of life.

657
00:48:25,886 --> 00:48:30,118
But what was the early atmosphere
made of, ordinary air?

658
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,349
If we start with
our present atmosphere...

659
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:34,959
...the experiment is a dismal failure.

660
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:37,960
Instead of making proteins
and nucleic acids...

661
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:41,566
...all we make is smog,
a backwards step.

662
00:48:41,769 --> 00:48:43,828
Why doesn't such an experiment work?

663
00:48:44,038 --> 00:48:47,599
Because the air of today
contains molecular oxygen.

664
00:48:47,808 --> 00:48:50,106
But oxygen is made by plants.

665
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:53,939
It's obvious that there were
no plants before the origin of life.

666
00:48:54,148 --> 00:48:56,378
We mustn't use oxygen
in our experiments...

667
00:48:56,583 --> 00:48:59,450
...because there wasn't any
in the early atmosphere.

668
00:49:04,758 --> 00:49:08,990
This is reasonable because the cosmos
is made mostly of hydrogen...

669
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,663
...which gobbles oxygen up.

670
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:14,960
The Earth's low gravity has
allowed most of our hydrogen gas...

671
00:49:15,169 --> 00:49:18,866
...to trickle away to space.
There's almost none left.

672
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,273
But 4 billion years ago...

673
00:49:21,475 --> 00:49:24,535
...our atmosphere was full
of hydrogen-rich gases:

674
00:49:24,745 --> 00:49:27,236
Methane, ammonia, water vapor.

675
00:49:27,448 --> 00:49:29,916
These are the gases we should use.

676
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:37,857
Taking great care to ensure
the purity of these gases...

677
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:42,188
...my colleague, Bishun Khare,
pumps them from their holding flasks.

678
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:58,772
An experiment like this
was first performed...

679
00:49:58,979 --> 00:50:03,006
...by Stanley Miller
and Harold Urey in the 1950s.

680
00:50:04,218 --> 00:50:06,311
(GASES FIZZLE)

681
00:50:19,032 --> 00:50:23,628
The starting gases are now introduced
into a large reaction vessel.

682
00:50:23,837 --> 00:50:28,035
We could shine ultraviolet light,
simulating the early sun.

683
00:50:28,242 --> 00:50:29,607
But in this experiment...

684
00:50:29,843 --> 00:50:32,107
...the gases will be sparked...

685
00:50:32,312 --> 00:50:36,248
...as the primitive atmosphere was
by early lightning.

686
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:51,627
(LIGHTNING BUZZES)

687
00:50:56,937 --> 00:51:01,397
After only a few hours,
the interior of the reaction vessel...

688
00:51:01,608 --> 00:51:04,736
...becomes streaked with
a strange brown pigment...

689
00:51:04,945 --> 00:51:08,472
...a rich collection
of complex organic molecules...

690
00:51:08,682 --> 00:51:13,244
...including the building blocks of
the proteins and the nucleic acids.

691
00:51:15,455 --> 00:51:19,084
Under the right conditions, these
building blocks assemble themselves...

692
00:51:19,293 --> 00:51:23,753
...into molecules resembling little
proteins and little nucleic acids.

693
00:51:23,964 --> 00:51:28,492
These nucleic acids can even make
identical copies of themselves.

694
00:51:33,941 --> 00:51:38,344
In this vessel are the notes
of the music of life...

695
00:51:38,545 --> 00:51:41,412
...although not yet the music itself.

696
00:51:43,951 --> 00:51:46,385
Now, no one, so far...

697
00:51:46,587 --> 00:51:50,956
...has mixed together the gases
and waters of the primitive Earth...

698
00:51:51,158 --> 00:51:56,095
...and at the end of the experiment
had something crawl out of the flask.

699
00:51:56,330 --> 00:51:59,959
There's still much to be understood
about the origin of life...

700
00:52:00,167 --> 00:52:02,499
...including the origin
of the genetic code.

701
00:52:02,703 --> 00:52:06,161
But we've only been at
such experiments for 30 years.

702
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:09,672
Nature's had
a 4-billion-year head start.

703
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:14,472
Incidentally, there's nothing in such
experiments that's unique to the Earth.

704
00:52:14,681 --> 00:52:18,276
The gases we start with,
the energy sources we use...

705
00:52:18,485 --> 00:52:21,215
...are entirely common
through the cosmos.

706
00:52:21,421 --> 00:52:25,949
So chemical reactions something like
these must be responsible for...

707
00:52:26,159 --> 00:52:28,320
...the organic matter
in interstellar space...

708
00:52:28,528 --> 00:52:30,894
...and the amino acids
in the meteorites.

709
00:52:31,098 --> 00:52:33,931
Similar chemical reactions
must have occurred...

710
00:52:34,134 --> 00:52:37,570
...on a billion other worlds
in the Milky Way galaxy.

711
00:52:37,771 --> 00:52:41,730
Look how easy it is to make
great globs of this stuff.

712
00:52:41,942 --> 00:52:46,208
The molecules of life fill the cosmos.

713
00:52:46,813 --> 00:52:47,871
Now...

714
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:51,248
What would life elsewhere look like?

715
00:52:51,451 --> 00:52:55,444
Even if it had an identical molecular
chemistry to life on Earth...

716
00:52:55,656 --> 00:52:57,487
...which I very much doubt...

717
00:52:57,691 --> 00:53:01,252
...it could not be
very similar in form...

718
00:53:01,461 --> 00:53:03,725
...to familiar organisms on the Earth.

719
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:07,093
The random character of
the evolutionary process...

720
00:53:07,301 --> 00:53:12,136
...must create elsewhere creatures
very different from any that we know.

721
00:53:13,907 --> 00:53:16,535
Think of a world
something like Jupiter...

722
00:53:16,743 --> 00:53:21,305
...with an atmosphere rich in hydrogen,
helium, methane, water and ammonia...

723
00:53:21,515 --> 00:53:23,176
...in which organic molecules
might be...

724
00:53:23,383 --> 00:53:26,113
...falling from the skies
like manna from heaven...

725
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:28,880
...like the products of
the Miller-Urey experiment.

726
00:53:29,089 --> 00:53:31,580
Could there be life on such a world?

727
00:53:32,526 --> 00:53:36,087
There's a special problem.
The atmosphere is turbulent...

728
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:39,925
...and down deep, before we ever
come to a surface, it's very hot.

729
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:43,796
If you're not careful,
you'll be carried down and fried.

730
00:53:44,004 --> 00:53:46,837
If you reproduce
before you're fried...

731
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:51,739
...turbulence will carry your offspring
into the higher and cooler layers.

732
00:53:51,945 --> 00:53:56,644
Such organisms could be very little.
We call them sinkers.

733
00:53:58,085 --> 00:54:01,213
The physicist E.E. Salpeter and I
at Cornell...

734
00:54:01,421 --> 00:54:04,015
...have calculated
something about the life...

735
00:54:04,224 --> 00:54:06,715
...that might exist on such a world.

736
00:54:08,762 --> 00:54:12,027
Vast living balloons could
stay buoyant...

737
00:54:12,232 --> 00:54:15,395
...by pumping heavy gases
from their interiors...

738
00:54:15,602 --> 00:54:17,593
...or by keeping their insides warm.

739
00:54:17,804 --> 00:54:20,534
They might eat the organic molecules
in the air...

740
00:54:20,741 --> 00:54:22,606
...or make their own with sunlight.

741
00:54:22,809 --> 00:54:26,142
We call these creatures floaters.

742
00:54:27,814 --> 00:54:30,180
We imagine floaters
kilometers across...

743
00:54:30,384 --> 00:54:33,820
...enormously larger than
the greatest whale that ever was...

744
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:37,421
...beings the size of cities.

745
00:54:37,624 --> 00:54:41,526
We conceive of them arrayed
in great, lazy herds...

746
00:54:41,728 --> 00:54:43,559
...as far as the eye can see...

747
00:54:43,764 --> 00:54:48,463
...concentrated in the updrafts
in the enormous sea of clouds.

748
00:54:48,668 --> 00:54:52,934
But there can be other creatures
in this alien environment: hunters.

749
00:54:54,808 --> 00:54:56,969
Hunters are fast and maneuverable.

750
00:54:57,177 --> 00:55:00,476
They eat the floaters,
both for their organic molecules...

751
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:02,773
...and for their store
of pure hydrogen.

752
00:55:02,983 --> 00:55:04,678
But there can't be many hunters...

753
00:55:04,885 --> 00:55:09,549
...because if they destroy all the
floaters, they themselves will perish.

754
00:55:13,093 --> 00:55:16,221
Physics and chemistry permit
such life forms.

755
00:55:16,430 --> 00:55:18,898
Art presents them with
a certain reality...

756
00:55:19,099 --> 00:55:22,762
...but nature is not obliged
to follow our speculations.

757
00:55:22,969 --> 00:55:27,565
If there are billions of inhabited
worlds in the Milky Way galaxy...

758
00:55:28,008 --> 00:55:32,502
...then I think it's likely there are
a few places which might have...

759
00:55:32,712 --> 00:55:34,111
...hunters...

760
00:55:34,314 --> 00:55:37,112
...and floaters and sinkers.

761
00:55:38,351 --> 00:55:42,583
Biology is more like history
than it is like physics.

762
00:55:42,789 --> 00:55:45,849
You have to know the past
to understand the present.

763
00:55:46,059 --> 00:55:50,223
There is no predictive theory of
biology, nor is there for history.

764
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:51,795
The reason is the same:

765
00:55:51,998 --> 00:55:55,331
Both subjects are still
too complicated for us.

766
00:55:55,535 --> 00:55:58,163
But we can understand ourselves
much better...

767
00:55:58,371 --> 00:56:00,601
...by understanding other cases.

768
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:05,733
The study of a single instance
of extraterrestrial life...

769
00:56:05,946 --> 00:56:09,438
No matter how humble,
a microbe would be just fine.

770
00:56:09,649 --> 00:56:12,584
...will de-provincialize biology.

771
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:16,381
It will show us what else is possible.

772
00:56:17,858 --> 00:56:22,795
We've heard so far the voice
of life on only a single world...

773
00:56:23,029 --> 00:56:25,395
...but for the first time,
as we shall see...

774
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:29,057
...we've begun
a serious scientific search...

775
00:56:29,269 --> 00:56:31,499
...for the cosmic fugue.

776
00:56:41,715 --> 00:56:44,980
Recently, we've learned more
about the origin of life.

777
00:56:45,185 --> 00:56:47,312
Do you remember RNA...

778
00:56:47,521 --> 00:56:50,888
...that nucleic acid
that our cells use as messengers...

779
00:56:51,091 --> 00:56:54,219
...carrying the genetic information
out of the cell nucleus?

780
00:56:54,895 --> 00:56:59,127
Well, it's been found that RNA,
like protein...

781
00:56:59,332 --> 00:57:01,596
...can control chemical reactions...

782
00:57:01,801 --> 00:57:05,464
...as well as reproduce itself,
which proteins can't do.

783
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:08,903
Many scientists now wonder
if the first life on Earth...

784
00:57:09,109 --> 00:57:11,270
...was an RNA molecule.

785
00:57:11,478 --> 00:57:14,936
It now seems feasible that
key molecular building blocks...

786
00:57:15,148 --> 00:57:19,084
...for the origin of life, fell out
of the skies 4 billion years ago.

787
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:24,256
Comets have been found to have a lot
of organic molecules in them...

788
00:57:24,457 --> 00:57:28,791
...and they fell in huge numbers
on the primitive Earth.

789
00:57:29,896 --> 00:57:32,729
We also mention the extinction
of the dinosaurs...

790
00:57:32,933 --> 00:57:36,869
...and most of the other species on
Earth about 65 million years ago.

791
00:57:37,070 --> 00:57:41,234
We now know that a large comet
hit the Earth at just that time.

792
00:57:41,441 --> 00:57:46,378
The dust pall from that collision
must've cooled and darkened the Earth...

793
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:49,648
...perhaps killing all
the dinosaurs, but sparing...

794
00:57:49,849 --> 00:57:54,309
...the small, furry mammals
who were our ancestors.

795
00:57:54,521 --> 00:57:58,389
Other cometary mass extinctions
in other epochs seem likely.

796
00:57:58,592 --> 00:58:02,926
If true, this would mean that
comets have been the bringers...

797
00:58:03,129 --> 00:58:05,597
...both of life and death.
