1
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:22,075
Hi ya sweetie.

2
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:24,077
They took the tube
out of his throat.

3
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:26,079
So now he's breathing
on his own.

4
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,581
He took a lot of damage
to his spleen.

5
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:30,583
They might have
to take it out.

6
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:31,584
Oh, my god.

7
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:32,585
I know.

8
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:35,088
I'm so scared.

9
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:36,589
Hey, listen,
listen.

10
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:39,592
This guy,
he's a tough kid.

11
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:42,095
If anybody could make it
through something like this,

12
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:43,596
it's christopher,
you hear me?

13
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:46,599
You got his holiness,
that's good.

14
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:49,102
He got shot too,
and survived.

15
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:50,603
Look!

16
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:52,605
Look what they did
to my son!

17
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:54,107
My son, those
sonsofbitches!

18
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:55,608
Easy, easy.

19
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:58,111
When you find him,

20
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:01,114
i want him to suffer,
you hear me, sil?

21
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:04,117
I want that motherfucker
in agony!

22
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:07,620
Don't worry, we'll
do the best we can.

23
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,123
Gismonte,
with a "g".

24
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:12,125
The kid who died,
right?

25
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,127
You never
heard of him?

26
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,628
No.

27
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:17,630
Well, him and his friend
matthew bevilaqua

28
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,632
ran around
with moltisanti.

29
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:24,637
Never saw him hanging out
with your buddy christopher?

30
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:27,140
I thought you wanted
to help your friend.

31
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:42,155
Hey.

32
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:44,157
Two days already,

33
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:46,659
i thought they were gonna
move him out of icu.

34
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,161
I think
he's getting better.

35
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:49,662
Good, you gotta
pray for him.

36
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,164
Hey, you gotta pray.

37
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:53,166
We are,
jesus.

38
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:56,669
Oh, i don't know
what i would do, uncle rich.

39
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:58,671
I love him
so much.

40
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:02,675
He's gonna make it.

41
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:05,178
I don't want
that fuck here.

42
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:06,179
I told him that.

43
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:08,181
He's full of
negative energies.

44
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,183
He said he'd only
come back here

45
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:11,684
if he had something
on matthew.

46
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:23,696
Start talking.

47
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:24,697
Back the fuck off.

48
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:28,201
Alright, what
do you got, rich?

49
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:31,204
The word is definitely
out on the fucking street

50
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,706
on this
bevilaqua kid.

51
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:38,711
Tommy biondi from otb
came up with a name,

52
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:42,215
a dealer named
quickie g.

53
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:44,717
He's been in the bing
a few times.

54
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:48,221
Or it might've been
this other prick, fast fatty.

55
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:51,724
I'm telling you
this won't take long.

56
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:55,728
I'll give this
bevilaqua kid five days

57
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:57,730
before somebody
brings his ass to us

58
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,232
to score points.

59
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:01,734
My brother
was in this hospital,

60
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:03,736
the bill was
75 pages long.

61
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:07,740
Eight dollars
for an aspirin.

62
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,744
So, did you hear about
ralph and mary rutaldo?

63
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:13,246
No, what happened?

64
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:15,748
You know ralphie has had
his brazilian goomar for years.

65
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:17,250
She's a dancer,
right?

66
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:21,254
She just gave birth
to ralph's baby,
a c- section.

67
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:34,767
Hey.

68
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:37,270
Why don't you try
and get some sleep?

69
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,271
Why?

70
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:40,273
Why?

71
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:46,779
Tomorrow's gonna be
another rough day,
that's why.

72
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:48,781
I don't think i'm gonna
sleep tonight.

73
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:50,283
Is this light
gonna bother you?

74
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:52,785
No.

75
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:59,292
Goodnight.

76
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:02,295
Tony?

77
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,797
I love you, tony.

78
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:07,800
I don't want
anybody getting hurt.

79
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:10,303
Not me,
not the kids,

80
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:11,804
not you.

81
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:14,307
Carmela, i can't do one of
these tearful things

82
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,809
till 5:00
in the morning tonight,
i just can't.

83
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:21,314
Not tonight.

84
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:25,818
Did you hear
about ralphie rutaldo?

85
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:27,820
What about him?

86
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:31,824
That brazilian
he keeps on the side?

87
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:33,326
Yeah?

88
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:35,328
She had a baby.

89
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:37,830
And christopher's
in the hospital,
this is on your mind now?

90
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,832
Maybe it
has to do with

91
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:42,335
the "ck one"
stinking up your shirt
last wednesday night.

92
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:43,836
It's over,
months ago!

93
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:45,338
Yeah, right.

94
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:46,839
"Yeah, right", what?
I told you i cut it off!

95
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:49,342
Listen tony, if you're gonna
keep doing what you do,

96
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:52,345
at the very least
i want you to get a vasectomy.

97
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:54,347
You want me
to do what?

98
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:55,848
Let's get real,
tony.

99
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:57,850
Do you have any idea
what a bastard child

100
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,352
would do
to this family?

101
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:01,854
You ever think about the shame
your children would feel?

102
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:03,356
You're putting us
all at risk.

103
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,865
I had her
tested for aids.

104
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:15,368
What do you
think i am?

105
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:02,415
Code blue icu 3,
code blue icu 3.

106
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:14,927
No, oh my god,
chrissy!

107
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:16,929
He's gonna die!

108
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:18,431
He'll be okay.

109
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:21,434
They said he was
gonna get better!

110
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:23,436
No!

111
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,438
No, let go
of me!

112
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:28,941
No, no!

113
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:38,451
Yeah.

114
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:41,454
What?

115
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:03,976
How is he?

116
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:07,480
His heart stopped.

117
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,982
They're working
their asses off on him.

118
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:11,484
Alright.

119
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:15,988
Well, we gotta
stay positive, right?

120
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:20,493
We gotta
give him that.

121
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,995
Positive vibes only.

122
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:56,529
Gentle and merciful
lord jesus,

123
00:09:56,529 --> 00:10:00,032
i want to speak to you now
with an open heart,

124
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:02,034
with an honest heart.

125
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:05,538
Tonight i ask you
to take my sins

126
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:09,542
and the sins of my family
into your merciful heart.

127
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:13,045
We have chosen this life
in full awareness

128
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:15,548
of the consequences
of our sins.

129
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:18,551
I know that christopher's life
is in your hands...

130
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:23,556
and his fate is your will.

131
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:26,559
I ask you humbly
to spare him.

132
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,062
And if it is your will
to spare him,

133
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:33,566
i ask that you deliver him
from blindness

134
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:37,069
and grant him vision.

135
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:41,073
And through this visio
n may he see your love...

136
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:46,078
and gain the strength
to carry on in service
to your mercy.

137
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:55,087
In the name of the father,
the son,

138
00:10:55,087 --> 00:11:01,093
and the holy spirit, amen.

139
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:03,596
Really, if i had
any reservations at all

140
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:05,097
i'd suggest
we move him right away.

141
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:07,600
But this is the best trauma unit
in the tri- state area.

142
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,101
I'm up on
all the ratings.

143
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:13,105
Thanks, hesh.

144
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:18,110
There's no
news yet.

145
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:21,113
Tony, it's
dr. Rueben.

146
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:24,116
Mr. Moltisanti suffered
cardiac and respiratory arrest

147
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:27,119
due to internal bleeding,
he was resuscitated.

148
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:29,121
The bleeding was
brought under control

149
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:30,623
and he's now
in stable condition.

150
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:33,626
What was the duration
of the arrest?

151
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:35,127
About a minute.

152
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:36,629
Is he stil
l intubated?

153
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,631
They're removing
the ventilator as we speak.

154
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:40,633
What the fuck you two
talking about?

155
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,134
The worst is over

156
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:45,137
but he was clinically dead
for about a minute.

157
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:48,140
Doctor, can i go in
and see him?

158
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,141
No, he's gonna
be in post- op

159
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:50,643
for about
four or five hours,

160
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:53,145
and then he asked
to speak to mr. Gualtieri.

161
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:54,647
Me?

162
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:57,650
He asked twice for
you and mr. Soprano.

163
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:12,164
Christopher.

164
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:15,167
Hey.

165
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:16,669
I'm sorry, t.

166
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:18,170
For what?

167
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:21,173
I know
you're mad at me.

168
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:24,176
What are you talking about?
I'm not mad at you.

169
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:27,179
Nobody's
mad at you.

170
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,683
I'm going to hell, t.

171
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:33,185
You're not going
anywhere but home.

172
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,688
I crossed over
to the other side.

173
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:37,690
You what?

174
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:41,694
I saw the tunnel
and the white light...

175
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:44,697
and i saw
my father in hell.

176
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:46,198
Get the fuck
out of here.

177
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:48,701
And the bouncer said
that i'd be there too

178
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,202
when my time comes.

179
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:51,203
What bouncer?

180
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:54,707
"The emerald piper",
that's our hell.

181
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:57,209
It's an irish bar

182
00:12:57,209 --> 00:13:02,214
where it's st. Patrick's day
everyday forever.

183
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:05,217
Mikey palmice
and brendan filone
were there too.

184
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:07,219
They were friends.

185
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,722
Those two guys
hated each other.

186
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:12,224
You gotta relax,
you just need some rest.

187
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,226
They're friends now.

188
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:16,729
They were playing dice
with two roman soldiers

189
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:18,731
and a bunch
of the irish guys.

190
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:20,232
Doesn't make sense.

191
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:23,235
The irish, they were
winning every roll.

192
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:26,739
And then mikey gave me
a message for both of you.

193
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:28,240
A message?

194
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:29,742
Yeah.

195
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:34,246
Yeah, he said...

196
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:37,249
"tell tony and paulie,
3:00."

197
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:39,251
3:00?

198
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:42,254
This fucking morphine drip
, i don't think it's working.

199
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:44,256
I don't feel
a fucking thing.

200
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:46,258
You gotta be
careful with that.

201
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:48,260
That was
all he said?

202
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,261
Who?

203
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:50,763
Mikey,
"3:00"?

204
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,264
Yeah.

205
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:56,268
What was
he wearing?

206
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:59,772
C'mon, let's go,
he needs his rest.

207
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:03,275
He had on a gangster suit,
pinstripe.

208
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:06,278
Old fashioned style.

209
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:08,280
Hey...

210
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,282
that was a dream.

211
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:13,285
Forget about it,
okay?

212
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:19,792
We're gonna
take you home soon.

213
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:23,796
Do they know this kid
likes his chemistry set
a little too much?

214
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:26,799
He's in pain,
what the fuck else
are they gonna do?

215
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:34,306
What time
was mikey hit?

216
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:36,809
How the fuck
do i know?

217
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,811
You were there,
weren't you?

218
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:39,812
It was
in the morning, right?

219
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:41,814
11:00, 10:00?

220
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:57,830
Alright, so i cheat--
i used to cheat.

221
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:01,333
I'm not getting spayed,
end of subject.

222
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,836
You brought up
the vasectomy,

223
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:05,838
now you don't
want to talk about it.

224
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:11,844
You asked me
what was going on.

225
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:17,850
I saw in the news
about a gangland shooting.

226
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,351
Yeah.

227
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:26,859
Is that your nephew christophe
that you've spoken of before?

228
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:29,361
In the papers they said
he was in critical condition.

229
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:31,363
He's gonna be fine.

230
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:33,866
Have they found the person
that shot him yet?

231
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:35,868
No...
have you?

232
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:38,370
I'm not trying to pry into
that part of your life.

233
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,873
I know our deal.

234
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:45,377
But i've heard you say before
that you love this young man.

235
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,387
Christopher was...

236
00:15:55,888 --> 00:16:01,393
clinically dead
for about a minute.

237
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:04,897
He thinks he had one of those
near death experiences.

238
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:07,900
Says he visited hell.

239
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,402
And they told him
he'd be back permanent.

240
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:12,404
Who's "they"?

241
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:14,907
It's bullshit,
it was a dream,

242
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:16,909
combined with
the morphine.

243
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:19,912
But now he thinks he's gonna
go to hell when he dies.

244
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:21,413
He's all fucked up
over it.

245
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,415
Do you think
he'll go to hell?

246
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:24,917
No.

247
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:32,925
He's not the type
that deserves hell.

248
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:35,427
Who do you
think does?

249
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:36,929
The worst people.

250
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:39,431
The twisted
and demented psychos

251
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:41,433
who kill people
for pleasure.

252
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:43,435
The cannibals,
the degenerate bastards

253
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:44,937
that molest and
torture little kids.

254
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:46,939
They kill babies.

255
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:48,440
The hitlers,
the pol pots.

256
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,442
Those are the evil fucks
that deserve to die.

257
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:52,444
Not my nephew.

258
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:55,447
What about you?

259
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:57,950
What?

260
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,451
Hell?

261
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:02,955
You been
listening to me?

262
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,456
No...

263
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:06,959
for the same reasons.

264
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,461
We're soldiers.

265
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:11,463
Soldiers don't
go to hell.

266
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:13,465
It's war.

267
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:15,968
Soldiers,
they kill other soldiers.

268
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:18,470
We're in a situation

269
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,974
where everybody involved
knows the stakes.

270
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:27,479
And if you're gonna
accept those stakes...

271
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:29,982
you gotta
do certain things.

272
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:34,987
It's business,
we're soldiers.

273
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:36,989
We follow codes...

274
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:38,991
orders.

275
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:41,994
So does that justify
everything that you do?

276
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:43,495
Excuse me,
let me tell you something.

277
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:45,497
When america opened
the floodgates

278
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:46,999
and let all us
italians in,

279
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,001
what do you think
they were doing it for?

280
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,003
Because they were trying
to save us from poverty?

281
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:53,505
No, they did it
because they needed us.

282
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:56,508
They needed us
to build their cities
and dig their subways

283
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:58,510
and to
make'em richer.

284
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,012
The carnegies
and the rockefellers,

285
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:02,014
they needed worker bees
and there we were.

286
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:04,016
But some of us didn't want
to swarm around their hive

287
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:05,517
and lose who we were.

288
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:07,019
We wanted
to stay italian

289
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,521
and preserve the things
that meant something to us.

290
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:11,523
Honor, and family,
and loyalty.

291
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:14,526
And some of us wanted
a piece of the action.

292
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:17,029
We weren't educate
d like the americans.

293
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:19,031
But we had the balls
to take what we wanted.

294
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:22,034
Those other fucks,
those other...

295
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:25,537
the j. P. Morgans,
they were crooks
and killers too,

296
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:27,039
but that was
a business, right?

297
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,540
The american way.

298
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,542
That might
all be true.

299
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:32,544
But what do
poor italian immigrants

300
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:34,546
have to do with you

301
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:38,550
and what happens every morning
you step out of bed?

302
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,552
What the fuck is this
all of a sudden?

303
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:42,554
I'm just asking
a question.

304
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:44,556
Oh, so you're taking
a stand here now.

305
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:46,558
Huh? You pick here
to make a stand?

306
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:48,060
After all this time,

307
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,562
telling me that
nothing's my fault

308
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:52,064
because of
poor parenting.

309
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:54,066
You pick now to act like
betsy- fucking- ross!

310
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:56,568
When my nephew's
in the fucking hospital!

311
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:58,570
He might not
get out!

312
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:16,588
What, what
3 o'clock again?

313
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:22,094
Quiet.

314
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:28,100
My wind chimes?

315
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,601
Sorry, hon.

316
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:32,604
Don't wake up
my kids, paulie.

317
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,106
Motherfucker.

318
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:39,111
Baby, you gotta
relax your thoughts.

319
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:45,617
Whatever christopher saw,
you can't take it personal.

320
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:49,621
Christopher's
a troubled kid.

321
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:54,626
Who knows
what's in his heart?

322
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:56,628
Come.

323
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:57,629
You're right.

324
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:01,633
I need to relax
with this.

325
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:07,139
Let me help you.

326
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:08,640
That is so weird.

327
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:10,642
What the fuck
you saying?

328
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:14,146
3:00?

329
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:16,648
Kenny and i were supposed
to be married at 1:00

330
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:19,151
in the fountainbleu room
at the roman gardens.

331
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:23,155
Mikey and jo- jo had
the bella vista room
booked for 3:00.

332
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:25,657
But the bella vista room
is smaller and has no windows.

333
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:28,160
A week
before the wedding

334
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,163
mikey saw the bella vista room
and flipped out!

335
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:33,165
He almost killed
the events manager.

336
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:35,667
So mikey and jo- jo
got the fountainbleu

337
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:38,670
and kenny and me wound up
in the bella vista room

338
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,673
at 3:00.

339
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,701
Fuck.

340
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,204
Just trying to
tidy up the place.

341
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:15,707
Go back to sleep.

342
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:17,709
Tidying up?

343
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,212
How you doing?

344
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:22,714
I'm doing.

345
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:24,216
I'll tell ya...

346
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:29,721
i'm still baffled by
this 3:00 thing though.

347
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:35,227
I wish i had
more for you, paulie,
but that's all he said.

348
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,729
Let me ask you
a question.

349
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:39,231
Yeah?

350
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,733
That bouncer
that sent you back,

351
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:44,736
did he have horns
on his head?

352
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:46,738
No.

353
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:49,741
He was just some
big irish goon
in old fashioned clothes.

354
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:51,743
Did anybody there
have horns

355
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:55,247
or buds for horns,
those goat bumps?

356
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:58,250
Paulie, it was
fucking hell, okay?

357
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,753
My father said he looses
every hand of cards he plays.

358
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:04,256
And every night
at midnight

359
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:06,758
they whack him the same way
he was whacked in life

360
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:10,762
and it's painful,
night after night.

361
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:13,765
Does that sound like
fucking heaven to you?

362
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:15,267
Was it hot?

363
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:16,768
Yeah...
i don't know.

364
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:18,270
What the fuck?

365
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,772
The heat would've been
the first thing you noticed.

366
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:21,773
Hell is hot.

367
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:23,775
That's never been
disputed by anybody.

368
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:25,777
You didn't
go to hell.

369
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:30,782
You went to purgatory,
my friend.

370
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:32,784
I forgot
all about purgatory.

371
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:34,786
Purgatory,

372
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:39,291
a little detour
on the way to paradise.

373
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,793
How long you think
we gotta stay there?

374
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:43,795
That's different
for everybody.

375
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:46,798
You add up all
your mortal sins,

376
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:48,800
multiply that number
by 50,

377
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,802
then you add up
all your venial sins

378
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:53,305
and multiply that
by 25.

379
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:55,307
You add them together,
and that's your sentence.

380
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:57,809
I figure i'm gonna have to do
about 6, 000 years

381
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:01,313
before i get
accepted into heaven.

382
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:04,316
And 6, 000 years is nothing
in eternity terms.

383
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:06,318
I could do that
standing on my head.

384
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:11,823
It's like a couple
of days here.

385
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:14,326
Was i insensitive?

386
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:19,331
And perhaps,
did i do it deliberately?

387
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:21,833
Do i hate him?

388
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:24,836
How often are you
taking the ativan?

389
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:27,839
Almost every night.

390
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:31,843
And when else?

391
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:35,847
Sunday afternoon
i took one.

392
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:38,850
There's another thing,
i've...

393
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:43,355
i've been drinking...

394
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:45,357
alone.

395
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:47,859
I'm glad
you're telling me.

396
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:58,870
Part of it is that
i'm afraid.

397
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,872
I've told him
my son is at bard.

398
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:05,377
Why did you agree to
continue working with him?

399
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:08,880
I took him back
because i felt it was

400
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:12,884
a professional
and ethical responsibility
to do so.

401
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:16,388
Jennifer, i'm not
challenging your ability

402
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:19,391
or professionalism
, or even your ethics.

403
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:22,894
Then what are you
challenging?

404
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:25,397
What you hope to
achieve with this man.

405
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:27,899
What do you hope
to achieve with me?

406
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:28,900
No, that's a--

407
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:34,906
a facile analogy.

408
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:38,910
I'm living in a moral
never never land
with this patient.

409
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:43,915
Not wanting to judge,
but to treat.

410
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:46,918
But now...
i've judged.

411
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:51,923
I took a position, goddamnit,
and i'm scared.

412
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:57,929
I feel for you.

413
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:17,449
You're late.

414
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:19,951
Does that
go on my record?

415
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:21,453
I'm talking about
common courtesy here.

416
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:22,954
I got a life
outside of this too.

417
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:23,955
Lucky you.

418
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:25,457
So, what
do you got?

419
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:26,958
I think he knows.

420
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:28,460
Knows what?

421
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,961
Or at least suspects.

422
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:31,463
Who, what?
What are you talking about?

423
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:33,965
He's been looking
at me different,
these glances.

424
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:34,966
Glances?

425
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:36,968
We had sandwiches brought in
the other night,

426
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:38,970
four with ham, salami,
cappicola,

427
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:41,473
one eggplant, and the other
with tomato and mozzarella.

428
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:42,474
Yeah, okay.

429
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:43,975
That's six total,
there were only five of us.

430
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:46,478
But tony said
he ordered the eggplant,
but i did,

431
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:48,980
and i know
for certain he ordered
the tomato/mozzarella.

432
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:49,981
Maybe he forgot.

433
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:51,483
No, no,
he never forgets.

434
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:52,984
So, what's
the bottom line?

435
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:54,986
He let me eat the eggplant
and he took the tomato.

436
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:56,488
But there was
a moment.

437
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:57,489
A glance.

438
00:25:57,489 --> 00:25:58,990
Yeah,
a fucking glance!

439
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,992
This is simple and
i'm gonna help you out here.

440
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:03,995
You gotta keep in mind
that you're the one
who's different now.

441
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:06,498
You're the one seeing
through different eyes.

442
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:07,999
You're the one
with the new attitude.

443
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:11,002
I know the man
and i see he's the one
who's different with me.

444
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:12,504
The odds
don't favor it.

445
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:14,506
Either way
it doesn't matter.

446
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:15,507
To you.

447
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:17,509
I wasn't the one
selling heroin, okay?

448
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:23,014
And i wasn't the one
who got pinned for it.

449
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:24,516
So what do i do?

450
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:26,017
What do you do?

451
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:28,019
You do everything
you can do do.

452
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:30,021
Do what you do to a girl
that you want to fuck.

453
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:32,023
Make him love you.

454
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:49,541
I'll be back first thing
in the morning.

455
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:52,544
What do you want
for breakfast?

456
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:55,046
You don't wake up
till lunch, ma.

457
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:57,549
Tomorrow i'll get up
early, alright?

458
00:26:57,549 --> 00:27:00,552
How about the peppers and eggs
on the round bread?

459
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:01,553
That sound
s great, ma.

460
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:04,055
Do you need
more time alone, jo?

461
00:27:04,055 --> 00:27:05,557
No, i'm ready.

462
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:07,058
Okay, chris.

463
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:09,060
Bye, ma.

464
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:20,572
If you want to sleep, it's okay,
i brought a book.

465
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:23,074
No, i just got up
ten minutes ago.

466
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:25,076
The painkillers
aren't helping?

467
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:30,081
No, they're pretty
fucking good.

468
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:33,084
I want to tell you something,
christopher.

469
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:37,088
The other night
when your heart stopped...

470
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,090
i walked the hall
to an empty room

471
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:42,093
and i prayed to jesus
to spare you.

472
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:44,095
And that
if he would spare you

473
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:46,097
i asked that
he grant you vision.

474
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:47,599
Sight.

475
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:50,602
So that you can see
the way to christ clearly.

476
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:52,604
Yeah, so?

477
00:27:52,604 --> 00:27:55,106
And he did
spare you.

478
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:58,109
And you saw,
christopher.

479
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:00,612
You saw something,

480
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:03,615
something that none of us
have ever seen.

481
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:11,573
So what did
he say to you?

482
00:28:11,573 --> 00:28:12,574
Who?

483
00:28:12,574 --> 00:28:13,575
Jesus.

484
00:28:13,575 --> 00:28:15,577
I didn't see jesus.

485
00:28:15,577 --> 00:28:17,579
Tony said that
you saw jesus smiling

486
00:28:17,579 --> 00:28:19,581
and he took you to see
your father in heaven

487
00:28:19,581 --> 00:28:21,583
and then he said
it wasn't your time.

488
00:28:21,583 --> 00:28:23,585
I was in hell,
carmela.

489
00:28:23,585 --> 00:28:24,586
You what?

490
00:28:25,086 --> 00:28:26,588
My father
was in hell

491
00:28:26,588 --> 00:28:29,090
and they said that's where
i'd go when it's my time.

492
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:32,594
Maybe it was purgatory,
but i don't know.

493
00:28:40,101 --> 00:28:43,104
Then you have to look
at this experience

494
00:28:43,104 --> 00:28:46,107
as an opportunity
to repent...

495
00:28:46,107 --> 00:28:49,611
to change your heart...

496
00:28:49,611 --> 00:28:52,614
to start to walk in
the light of the lord.

497
00:28:52,614 --> 00:28:54,616
You were blessed
by this, christopher.

498
00:28:54,616 --> 00:28:57,619
You were blessed
with a second chance.

499
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:00,622
I don't know,
carmela.

500
00:29:00,622 --> 00:29:02,123
Well, i do know.

501
00:29:02,624 --> 00:29:06,127
And i am gonna pray
like i did the other night

502
00:29:06,127 --> 00:29:08,630
and i'm gonna pray
every day from now on.

503
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:13,134
It is not too late for you,
christopher...

504
00:29:13,134 --> 00:29:17,138
if you pray.

505
00:29:17,138 --> 00:29:22,644
Will you pray?

506
00:29:22,644 --> 00:29:27,148
You just have to
follow me.

507
00:29:27,148 --> 00:29:30,151
In the name of the father,
the son,

508
00:29:30,151 --> 00:29:32,654
and the holy spirit.

509
00:29:47,168 --> 00:29:49,170
How was he?

510
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:50,171
Fine.

511
00:29:50,171 --> 00:29:51,673
The same.

512
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,182
Is there
any news?

513
00:30:01,182 --> 00:30:03,184
No.

514
00:30:12,694 --> 00:30:15,196
So, what?
We're not talking now?

515
00:30:15,196 --> 00:30:18,199
I said what i had
to say, tony.

516
00:30:18,199 --> 00:30:20,201
If you can't
be honest with me,

517
00:30:20,201 --> 00:30:23,204
at least have the balls
to be honest with yourself.

518
00:30:23,204 --> 00:30:24,706
Oh, i got balls.

519
00:30:24,706 --> 00:30:27,208
And as long as i do,
they will remain intact.

520
00:30:27,208 --> 00:30:30,211
If you don't have faith in me,
it's up to you.

521
00:30:30,211 --> 00:30:32,213
You gotta prove it
to yourself first, tony.

522
00:30:32,213 --> 00:30:34,215
To yourself
and god.

523
00:30:34,215 --> 00:30:36,718
You and god,
carmela.

524
00:30:36,718 --> 00:30:38,219
You're only religious
when it suits you.

525
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,722
What is that
supposed to mean?

526
00:30:40,722 --> 00:30:42,223
Come here.

527
00:30:50,231 --> 00:30:52,233
No, no, what is that
supposed to mean?

528
00:30:52,233 --> 00:30:54,235
The pope doesn't even
believe in trojans

529
00:30:54,235 --> 00:30:55,737
and you want me
to get snipped.

530
00:30:55,737 --> 00:30:57,739
Isn't that a little
hypocritical?

531
00:30:57,739 --> 00:31:00,742
Look, tony, i'm thinking o
f my family first, that's all.

532
00:31:00,742 --> 00:31:02,744
Whatever's down here
is god's creation.

533
00:31:02,744 --> 00:31:05,246
Isn't it a sin to undo
the good work he's done?

534
00:31:05,747 --> 00:31:12,253
You should know,
you made a living of it.

535
00:31:12,253 --> 00:31:17,759
You're un- fucking- believable,
you know that?

536
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:23,765
Look what i made
that living for, hmm?

537
00:31:23,765 --> 00:31:25,767
What the fuck
you doing?

538
00:31:25,767 --> 00:31:26,768
You had dinner
an hour ago.

539
00:31:27,268 --> 00:31:29,270
What the fuck are you
doing to yourself?

540
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:33,775
Tony,
leave him alone.

541
00:31:33,775 --> 00:31:36,778
I'm supposed to get a vasectomy
when this is my male heir?

542
00:31:36,778 --> 00:31:38,780
Look at him.

543
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,782
Tony, come back here
and apologize!

544
00:31:51,292 --> 00:31:52,794
You're draggin'
me to hell!

545
00:31:52,794 --> 00:31:54,796
What's the matter,
what's the matter?

546
00:31:54,796 --> 00:31:55,797
You're draggin'
me to hell!

547
00:31:55,797 --> 00:31:57,298
Paulie, paulie,

548
00:31:57,298 --> 00:31:58,800
you had
a nightmare, honey.

549
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,302
Mama, somebody was screaming,
i'm scared.

550
00:32:01,302 --> 00:32:03,805
I know, honey,
it's okay, it's okay.

551
00:32:03,805 --> 00:32:05,807
Uncle paulie
had a bad dream.

552
00:32:05,807 --> 00:32:07,809
Mommy!

553
00:32:07,809 --> 00:32:09,310
Come here,
baby.

554
00:32:09,811 --> 00:32:11,312
It's alright,
it's alright.

555
00:32:11,312 --> 00:32:13,314
It's okay,
sweetheart.

556
00:32:13,314 --> 00:32:14,816
I'm putting them
to bed.

557
00:32:14,816 --> 00:32:17,819
Then i'm going home
to sleep.

558
00:32:17,819 --> 00:32:22,824
I don't need to keep
everyone up with this.

559
00:32:22,824 --> 00:32:26,327
C'mon,
let's go to sleep.

560
00:32:26,327 --> 00:32:28,329
Come talk to me.

561
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:40,341
How much can you
believe in dreams?

562
00:32:40,341 --> 00:32:42,343
Wait, wrong.

563
00:32:42,343 --> 00:32:44,345
Christopher did not
have a dream.

564
00:32:44,345 --> 00:32:47,348
I dream,
i'd make my peace.

565
00:32:47,348 --> 00:32:49,350
He was dead.

566
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:52,854
Science said he was dead,
science.

567
00:32:52,854 --> 00:32:54,856
You need to
talk to someone

568
00:32:54,856 --> 00:32:57,358
who deals with this kind
of thing professionally.

569
00:32:57,358 --> 00:32:58,860
What kind of thing?

570
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,862
He's in
new york, paulie,

571
00:33:00,862 --> 00:33:03,364
in nyack.

572
00:33:03,364 --> 00:33:05,867
His name is cullen,
he's a psychic.

573
00:33:05,867 --> 00:33:07,869
A psychic, get the fuck
out of here.

574
00:33:07,869 --> 00:33:10,371
He's famous for contacting
dead relatives for people.

575
00:33:10,371 --> 00:33:12,373
He contacted
my dead friend ronnie.

576
00:33:12,373 --> 00:33:13,875
Remember ronnie
with the arm?

577
00:33:13,875 --> 00:33:15,376
Yeah.

578
00:33:15,376 --> 00:33:16,878
He knew all about
the fingers at the elbow

579
00:33:16,878 --> 00:33:18,880
and i didn't
even tell him.

580
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,381
He said,
"johnnie is here."

581
00:33:20,381 --> 00:33:22,383
And i told him
i didn't know any johnnie's,

582
00:33:22,383 --> 00:33:25,887
but then he said,"well, one arm
is shorter than the other.

583
00:33:25,887 --> 00:33:27,889
Does that mean
anything to you?"

584
00:33:28,389 --> 00:33:31,893
Ronnie,
it was ronnie.

585
00:33:31,893 --> 00:33:34,896
Jesus,
fucking creep show.

586
00:33:34,896 --> 00:33:38,399
You got nothing to lose
except the nightmares.

587
00:33:44,405 --> 00:33:47,408
What's up?
Paulie around?

588
00:33:47,408 --> 00:33:48,409
No.

589
00:33:48,409 --> 00:33:49,410
Sil?

590
00:33:49,911 --> 00:33:52,413
What the fuck, i'm here,
you talk to me.

591
00:33:52,413 --> 00:33:53,915
You got something?

592
00:33:53,915 --> 00:33:56,417
You better
remember me, man.

593
00:33:56,417 --> 00:33:58,920
Yeah, i will,
now, you got something?

594
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,422
Alright.

595
00:34:01,923 --> 00:34:03,925
Hacklebarney
state park.

596
00:34:03,925 --> 00:34:06,928
You know where that
"george washington
slept- here- house" is?

597
00:34:06,928 --> 00:34:08,930
Up that road there
is a gray house.

598
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:10,431
Bevilaqua's there?

599
00:34:10,932 --> 00:34:12,934
20 bucks, baby.

600
00:34:24,445 --> 00:34:26,948
Are you telling me
that's who you are

601
00:34:26,948 --> 00:34:31,452
or that's who he is?

602
00:34:31,452 --> 00:34:36,457
I see.

603
00:34:36,457 --> 00:34:40,461
Right.

604
00:34:40,461 --> 00:34:44,465
The spirit put
him on hold.

605
00:34:44,465 --> 00:34:47,969
Do you take the name
gregory?

606
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:48,970
My father.

607
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:50,471
I understand now.

608
00:34:50,972 --> 00:34:54,475
You're gregory,
this is your son.

609
00:34:54,475 --> 00:34:56,477
Is your name
daniel?

610
00:34:56,477 --> 00:34:57,979
Yes.

611
00:34:57,979 --> 00:35:03,985
'Cause i got this image of
daniel in the lion's den.

612
00:35:03,985 --> 00:35:06,487
He says
you found his body.

613
00:35:06,487 --> 00:35:07,989
Oh, my god.

614
00:35:08,489 --> 00:35:09,490
He's sorry.

615
00:35:09,991 --> 00:35:12,493
He knows
how traumatic that was.

616
00:35:12,493 --> 00:35:15,997
He couldn't
take the pain anymore.

617
00:35:23,504 --> 00:35:26,007
Gregory, i'm sorry,
could you repeat that?

618
00:35:35,516 --> 00:35:39,520
He wants you to know
that he was there with you.

619
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,524
And that you
should move on.

620
00:35:43,524 --> 00:35:45,526
Yes, go ahead.

621
00:35:55,036 --> 00:36:01,542
What's
the problem?

622
00:36:01,542 --> 00:36:03,544
What the hell's
the matter?

623
00:36:03,544 --> 00:36:07,048
Please, go on.

624
00:36:07,048 --> 00:36:11,552
He can't hurt you,
you don't have to be afraid.

625
00:36:11,552 --> 00:36:13,554
I understand, yes.

626
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:21,062
I feel your anger.

627
00:36:21,062 --> 00:36:23,064
Who the fuck
are you talking to?

628
00:36:23,564 --> 00:36:24,565
Charles.

629
00:36:24,565 --> 00:36:26,567
Yes, yes,
you have a son.

630
00:36:26,567 --> 00:36:29,570
You're wit
h your son?

631
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:32,073
What the fuck?
I don't got no kids.

632
00:36:32,073 --> 00:36:34,075
Oh, sonny.

633
00:36:34,075 --> 00:36:36,077
Pagano?

634
00:36:36,077 --> 00:36:41,082
Kind spirit,
is your name sonny?

635
00:36:41,082 --> 00:36:43,084
Charles pagano.

636
00:36:43,584 --> 00:36:45,586
How the fuck
do you know that?

637
00:36:45,586 --> 00:36:47,588
He says
he was your first.

638
00:36:47,588 --> 00:36:50,091
But i feel many more.

639
00:36:50,091 --> 00:36:50,591
Hey!

640
00:36:51,092 --> 00:36:52,593
That one's
laughing.

641
00:36:52,593 --> 00:36:54,095
Poison ivy?

642
00:36:54,095 --> 00:36:57,098
He wants to know
if it still itches.

643
00:36:57,598 --> 00:37:00,601
Don't fuck with me,
who you been talking to?

644
00:37:00,601 --> 00:37:02,603
I'm afraid i'm gonna have to
ask you to leave.

645
00:37:02,603 --> 00:37:03,604
Why?

646
00:37:04,105 --> 00:37:05,606
What the fuck
are they saying?

647
00:37:06,107 --> 00:37:08,109
You really want me
to say it?

648
00:37:08,609 --> 00:37:11,112
Fuck you
and this bullshit.

649
00:37:11,112 --> 00:37:13,114
That's what this is,
you know.

650
00:37:13,114 --> 00:37:15,616
Satanic black magic,

651
00:37:15,616 --> 00:37:17,118
sick shit!

652
00:37:17,118 --> 00:37:20,121
I'm asking you
to leave, sir.

653
00:37:20,121 --> 00:37:21,622
Yeah?

654
00:37:21,622 --> 00:37:23,624
Fucking queers!

655
00:37:37,638 --> 00:37:43,144
When i made my appointment
, i gave the name ted hughes.

656
00:37:43,644 --> 00:37:45,646
Did you call
from your house?

657
00:37:45,646 --> 00:37:48,149
I'm not a moron, t.

658
00:37:48,649 --> 00:37:51,652
I knew this might
be a scam.

659
00:37:51,652 --> 00:37:57,158
So i called him
from a pathmark.

660
00:37:57,158 --> 00:37:59,660
There's
no denying it.

661
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:02,163
I'm dragging a bunch of
fucking ghouls around with me

662
00:38:02,163 --> 00:38:06,167
and mikey's
their fucking ringleader.

663
00:38:06,167 --> 00:38:08,169
Alright...

664
00:38:08,169 --> 00:38:10,671
paulie...
think about it.

665
00:38:10,671 --> 00:38:13,174
You whacked a bunch of
heavy hitters in your time,

666
00:38:13,674 --> 00:38:15,676
now, you think they're gonna
all join together

667
00:38:15,676 --> 00:38:17,178
and follow
that prick mikey?

668
00:38:17,178 --> 00:38:19,180
How can you
just sit there?

669
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:21,182
He warned you
about 3:00 too.

670
00:38:21,182 --> 00:38:22,683
I don't believe
any of this shit.

671
00:38:23,184 --> 00:38:26,687
It doesn't mean
a fucking thing to me.

672
00:38:28,189 --> 00:38:30,191
I was ready to write
the whole thing off

673
00:38:30,191 --> 00:38:32,693
until this psychic mentioned
little sonny pagano.

674
00:38:32,693 --> 00:38:35,196
But, that?
I don't know.

675
00:38:35,196 --> 00:38:38,199
I did this guy
over 30 years ago, t.

676
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:40,201
How the fuck
did he know that?

677
00:38:40,201 --> 00:38:42,203
Does he know where
matt bevilaqua is?

678
00:38:42,203 --> 00:38:44,705
Did you ask the fucking
ghostbuster that?

679
00:38:44,705 --> 00:38:47,708
'Cause we're out there
breaking our ass
trying to find this kid,

680
00:38:47,708 --> 00:38:49,710
and you're up there
fucking around in nyack.

681
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:53,214
He deals only
with the dead.

682
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,222
You eat steak?

683
00:39:01,222 --> 00:39:03,224
What the fuck
you talking about?

684
00:39:03,224 --> 00:39:06,227
If you were in india,
you would go to hell for that.

685
00:39:06,227 --> 00:39:08,229
I'm not in india,
what do i give a fuck?

686
00:39:08,229 --> 00:39:10,231
That's what i'm trying
to tell you.

687
00:39:10,731 --> 00:39:12,733
None of this shit
means a goddamn thing.

688
00:39:36,757 --> 00:39:38,259
I'm not hungry.

689
00:39:38,259 --> 00:39:40,761
You mind if i sit here
while i eat?

690
00:40:03,284 --> 00:40:06,287
I'm sorry for talking to you
the way i did.

691
00:40:06,287 --> 00:40:09,790
It's okay.

692
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:12,793
No...
it's not.

693
00:40:12,793 --> 00:40:15,296
I was wrong.

694
00:40:15,296 --> 00:40:19,800
And i hope you know
i didn't mean it.

695
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,803
I said it'cause
all the anger and frustration

696
00:40:23,304 --> 00:40:30,311
of the last few days
built up inside me and exploded.

697
00:40:30,311 --> 00:40:32,813
There's no excuse
for that.

698
00:40:32,813 --> 00:40:36,317
I gotta learn to
control my emotions
around the people i love.

699
00:40:42,323 --> 00:40:44,325
I think
you're the same way.

700
00:40:44,825 --> 00:40:46,827
I think,
your feelings,

701
00:40:47,328 --> 00:40:49,330
you keep'em inside,

702
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:55,336
and you and me,
we react without thinking.

703
00:40:55,836 --> 00:40:58,839
That's why i get mad at you,
i see myself in you.

704
00:41:04,845 --> 00:41:08,849
I couldn't ask

And i mean that.

706
00:41:14,855 --> 00:41:19,360
Thanks.

707
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,862
Want a piece of pizza?

708
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:37,378
Here.

709
00:41:37,878 --> 00:41:39,380
Pussy's

710
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,382
He says
it's urgent.

711
00:41:56,397 --> 00:41:58,399
I been calling you all
over the fucking place.

712
00:41:58,399 --> 00:41:59,900
I'll be
right there.

713
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:04,405
What's going on?

714
00:42:04,405 --> 00:42:06,407
Nothing.

715
00:42:21,922 --> 00:42:24,425
He's way the fuck out
near morristown,

716
00:42:24,925 --> 00:42:26,427
in hacklebarney
state park.

717
00:42:26,927 --> 00:42:30,431
Over by that "george washington
slept- here- house"?

718
00:42:30,431 --> 00:42:34,935
Yeah.

719
00:42:35,436 --> 00:42:36,937
Give me one.

720
00:42:36,937 --> 00:42:39,440
You don't
have to do this.

721
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:44,445
Furio and me
are on it.

722
00:42:44,445 --> 00:42:46,447
I want to do this.

723
00:42:46,447 --> 00:42:49,450
Good.

724
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:50,951
Cut furio loose.

725
00:42:51,452 --> 00:42:53,454
Three's a crowd.

726
00:43:17,478 --> 00:43:19,480
Why don't you just
take it easy?

727
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:21,982
We just want
to talk to you.

728
00:43:21,982 --> 00:43:24,485
That's all.

729
00:43:24,485 --> 00:43:30,491
It wasn't me,
it was sean,
just sean.

730
00:43:30,991 --> 00:43:32,493
You're shaking.

731
00:43:32,493 --> 00:43:35,996
You're gonna fucking kill me
for something i didn't do.

732
00:43:41,502 --> 00:43:44,004
Don't you think we could've
killed you already,

733
00:43:44,004 --> 00:43:46,507
if we
wanted you dead.

734
00:43:46,507 --> 00:43:48,008
Relax.

735
00:43:48,509 --> 00:43:50,511
We just want
to talk to you.

736
00:43:50,511 --> 00:43:51,512
Tony, it was sean!

737
00:43:52,012 --> 00:43:54,014
You got to believe me,
it was sean, he got nuts!

738
00:43:54,014 --> 00:43:56,517
He said we're being pissed on
and disrespected

739
00:43:56,517 --> 00:43:58,519
and that we should
score points with richie.

740
00:43:58,519 --> 00:44:03,023
But i told him rome wasn't
built in one day!

741
00:44:03,524 --> 00:44:10,030
Anything tony, i'll tell you
anything you want to know.

742
00:44:10,531 --> 00:44:12,032
What did
richie say?

743
00:44:12,533 --> 00:44:14,535
It nothing to do with richie,
he didn't ask for it.

744
00:44:15,035 --> 00:44:16,537
He got mad
when i told him.

745
00:44:17,037 --> 00:44:22,042
Sean did it on spec.

746
00:44:22,042 --> 00:44:23,043
Alright.

747
00:44:23,544 --> 00:44:25,045
Come here.

748
00:44:25,045 --> 00:44:27,047
Come here,
c'mon.

749
00:44:32,553 --> 00:44:35,556
Are you sure nobody else
was involved?

750
00:44:35,556 --> 00:44:38,058
Take a minute,
think it over.

751
00:44:38,058 --> 00:44:40,561
It was sea
n all the way.

752
00:44:46,567 --> 00:44:48,569
Alright.

753
00:44:48,569 --> 00:44:53,073
You're a good kid.

754
00:44:53,574 --> 00:44:55,576
I'm thirsty.

755
00:44:55,576 --> 00:44:59,580
See if we got
something to drink.

756
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:01,582
What can
i get you?

757
00:45:01,582 --> 00:45:04,084
You want a fanta,
something like that?

758
00:45:23,604 --> 00:45:25,105
How is that?

759
00:45:25,105 --> 00:45:27,608
I mean, you sure
you want a diet drink?

760
00:45:27,608 --> 00:45:30,611
You don't want something
with some sugar in it?

761
00:45:30,611 --> 00:45:32,613
There's only diet.

762
00:45:33,113 --> 00:45:39,119
It's good.

763
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:45,125
You finished?

764
00:45:45,125 --> 00:45:46,627
Thank you, t.

765
00:45:47,127 --> 00:45:48,629
'Cause that
sugarless motherfucker,

766
00:45:48,629 --> 00:45:51,131
it's the last fucking drink
you're ever gonna have.

767
00:45:51,131 --> 00:45:53,133
I swear to god,
mommy!

768
00:45:53,634 --> 00:45:56,637
Mommy, please, tony,
please!

769
00:46:27,167 --> 00:46:30,170
23 years of donations
to your parish

770
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:32,172
and this is what
this guy sees hanging over me?

771
00:46:32,673 --> 00:46:34,675
You should've never gone
to a psychic.

772
00:46:34,675 --> 00:46:36,677
It's divination,
it's the devil.

773
00:46:36,677 --> 00:46:40,180
They're completely
unsanctioned by the church.

774
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:42,683
Psychics are
heretics and thieves

775
00:46:42,683 --> 00:46:44,685
who practice witchcraft.

776
00:46:44,685 --> 00:46:47,688
There's no validity
to anything he told you.

777
00:46:47,688 --> 00:46:50,190
Your problem's
a spiritual matter.

778
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:51,191
Maybe.

779
00:46:51,692 --> 00:46:53,193
But irregardless,

780
00:46:53,193 --> 00:46:56,196
i should've had immunity
to all of this shit.

781
00:46:56,196 --> 00:46:59,199
I should've been covered
by my donations.

782
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:01,702
When the organ needed
a reed job who was there?

783
00:47:01,702 --> 00:47:04,204
When the priest
and the alter boys
needed new whites,

784
00:47:04,204 --> 00:47:06,707
who picked up
the tab?

785
00:47:06,707 --> 00:47:08,208
You should've
come to me first

786
00:47:08,208 --> 00:47:10,711
and none of this
would've happened.

787
00:47:10,711 --> 00:47:12,713
But don't worry, paul,
i'm here.

788
00:47:12,713 --> 00:47:14,214
I can help you.

789
00:47:14,214 --> 00:47:16,216
It's too late.

790
00:47:16,216 --> 00:47:19,219
You've been slacking off on me
and you left me unprotected.

791
00:47:19,219 --> 00:47:21,221
I'm cutting you off
for good.

792
00:47:21,221 --> 00:47:23,724
You ain't never gonna see
another dime from me.

793
00:48:05,265 --> 00:48:07,768
A rich man and a poor man
got the same wedding anniversary

794
00:48:08,268 --> 00:48:10,771
and every year they meet
on madison avenue

795
00:48:10,771 --> 00:48:12,773
when their shopping
for their wives.

796
00:48:12,773 --> 00:48:15,275
So the poor man
says to the rich man,

797
00:48:15,275 --> 00:48:16,777
"what'd you buy
your wife this year?"

798
00:48:16,777 --> 00:48:18,779
He says,"i got her
a huge diamond ring

799
00:48:18,779 --> 00:48:20,280
and a brand new
mercedes."

800
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,282
Poor man says,"what'd you
get her both for?"

801
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:23,784
Rich man says,

802
00:48:23,784 --> 00:48:25,786
"if she don't
like the diamond ring

803
00:48:26,286 --> 00:48:31,792
she can bring it back
in the mercedes
and still be happy."

804
00:48:31,792 --> 00:48:33,293
Rich man says
to the poor man,

805
00:48:33,293 --> 00:48:35,295
"what'd you get
your wife this year?"

806
00:48:35,295 --> 00:48:37,798
He says, i got her
a pair of slippers and dildo."

807
00:48:37,798 --> 00:48:40,801
Rich man says,"what'd you
get her a pair of slippers
and a dildo for?"

808
00:48:40,801 --> 00:48:42,302
And the poor man says,

809
00:48:42,302 --> 00:48:49,810
"she don't like the slippers
she can go fuck herself."

810
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:53,313
Can i get
another heineken?

811
00:48:53,313 --> 00:48:56,316
Remember the first time
you brought me here?

812
00:48:56,316 --> 00:48:57,818
Yeah,
i remember.

813
00:48:57,818 --> 00:49:01,822
Popped my cherry
that night.

814
00:49:01,822 --> 00:49:04,324
Yeah, seems like
old times.

815
00:49:14,835 --> 00:49:16,336
Puss.

816
00:49:21,341 --> 00:49:24,845
You believe in god?

817
00:49:24,845 --> 00:49:27,848
Yeah, i do, ton',
absolutely.

818
00:49:28,348 --> 00:49:31,351
Works in very mysterious ways
his wonders to perform,

819
00:49:31,351 --> 00:49:32,853
but no doubt,

820
00:49:32,853 --> 00:49:37,357
he's been
very good to me.

821
00:49:37,357 --> 00:49:38,358
Salut.

822
00:50:00,881 --> 00:50:04,885
Hi.

823
00:50:04,885 --> 00:50:07,387
Hey.

824
00:50:07,387 --> 00:50:09,389
How you doing?

825
00:50:09,389 --> 00:50:13,393
Fine.

826
00:50:13,393 --> 00:50:18,398
You?

827
00:50:18,398 --> 00:50:21,401
Good.

828
00:50:21,401 --> 00:50:22,903
Yeah?

829
00:51:05,445 --> 00:51:07,948
I've been thinking...

830
00:51:14,454 --> 00:51:19,960
what?

831
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:21,461
I'll do it.

832
00:51:27,968 --> 00:51:30,971
You'll do what?

833
00:51:30,971 --> 00:51:32,472
Snip- snip.

834
00:51:38,979 --> 00:51:44,985
I don't want you
to do it, tony.

835
00:51:44,985 --> 00:51:46,486
No, you want me
to do it.

836
00:51:46,486 --> 00:51:48,488
And now
i want to do it.

837
00:51:48,488 --> 00:51:49,990
So...

838
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:52,492
we'll do it.

839
00:51:58,999 --> 00:52:02,002
I started thinking...

840
00:52:02,002 --> 00:52:07,007
meadow is
leaving soon...

841
00:52:07,007 --> 00:52:11,511
and i may want to
have another baby.

842
00:52:12,012 --> 00:52:16,016
Maybe.

843
00:52:16,016 --> 00:52:19,019
What, are you trying
to drive me fucking crazy?

844
00:52:19,019 --> 00:52:22,022
What's behind
all this?

845
00:52:22,022 --> 00:52:24,024
Ralphie rutald
o and his goomar,

846
00:52:24,024 --> 00:52:25,525
then the vasectomy
, then no vasectomy,

847
00:52:25,525 --> 00:52:29,029
and now this, huh?

848
00:52:29,029 --> 00:52:34,534
Now you don't
want me cut?

849
00:52:34,534 --> 00:52:39,039
Tony...

850
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:41,541
all i want
is you.

851
00:52:41,541 --> 00:52:48,048
That's all
i have ever wanted.

852
00:52:48,048 --> 00:52:53,053
And i want you to be true
and to be mine.

853
00:52:53,053 --> 00:52:56,556
I want you
to not cheat.

854
00:52:56,556 --> 00:52:59,059
I will be true, carm,

855
00:52:59,059 --> 00:53:00,560

856
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:03,063
If you're not gonna
believe me, then fine.

857
00:53:03,063 --> 00:53:07,567
What can i do?

858
00:53:07,567 --> 00:53:12,072
I don't know.

859
00:53:12,072 --> 00:53:14,574
What can i do?

860
00:53:22,582 --> 00:53:24,584
Prove it to me.

861
