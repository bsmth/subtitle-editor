1
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:21,875
Hi ya sweetie.


2
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,877
They took the tube
out of his throat.


3
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:25,879
So now he's breathing
on his own.


4
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:28,381
He took a lot of damage
to his spleen.


5
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:30,383
They might have
to take it out.


6
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:31,384
Oh, my god.


7
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:32,385
I know.


8
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,888
I'm so scared.


9
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,389
Hey, listen,
listen.


10
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:39,392
This guy,
he's a tough kid.


11
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:41,895
If anybody could make it
through something like this,


12
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:43,396
it's christopher,
you hear me?


13
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:46,399
You got his holiness,
that's good.


14
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:48,902
He got shot too,
and survived.


15
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,403
Look!


16
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:52,405
Look what they did
to my son!


17
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:53,907
My son, those
sonsofbitches!


18
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:55,408
Easy, easy.


19
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:57,911
When you find him,


20
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:00,914
i want him to suffer,
you hear me, sil?


21
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:03,917
I want that motherfucker
in agony!


22
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:07,420
Don't worry, we'll
do the best we can.


23
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,923
Gismonte,
with a "g".


24
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:11,925
The kid who died,
right?


25
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:13,927
You never
heard of him?


26
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:15,428
No.


27
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:17,430
Well, him and his friend
matthew bevilaqua


28
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,432
ran around
with moltisanti.


29
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:24,437
Never saw him hanging out
with your buddy christopher?


30
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:26,940
I thought you wanted
to help your friend.


31
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:41,955
Hey.


32
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:43,957
Two days already,


33
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:46,459
i thought they were gonna
move him out of icu.


34
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:47,961
I think
he's getting better.


35
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:49,462
Good, you gotta
pray for him.


36
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:50,964
Hey, you gotta pray.


37
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:52,966
We are,
jesus.


38
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:56,469
Oh, i don't know
what i would do, uncle rich.


39
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,471
I love him
so much.


40
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:02,475
He's gonna make it.


41
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,978
I don't want
that fuck here.


42
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:05,979
I told him that.


43
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,981
He's full of
negative energies.


44
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:09,983
He said he'd only
come back here


45
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:11,484
if he had something
on matthew.


46
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:23,496
Start talking.


47
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:24,497
Back the fuck off.


48
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:28,001
Alright, what
do you got, rich?


49
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:31,004
The word is definitely
out on the fucking street


50
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:33,506
on this
bevilaqua kid.


51
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:38,511
Tommy biondi from otb
came up with a name,


52
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:42,015
a dealer named
quickie g.


53
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:44,517
He's been in the bing
a few times.


54
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:48,021
Or it might've been
this other prick, fast fatty.


55
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:51,524
I'm telling you
this won't take long.


56
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:55,528
I'll give this
bevilaqua kid five days


57
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:57,530
before somebody
brings his ass to us


58
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,032
to score points.


59
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:01,534
My brother
was in this hospital,


60
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:03,536
the bill was
75 pages long.


61
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:07,540
Eight dollars
for an aspirin.


62
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,544
So, did you hear about
ralph and mary rutaldo?


63
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:13,046
No, what happened?


64
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:15,548
You know ralphie has had
his brazilian goomar for years.


65
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:17,050
She's a dancer,
right?


66
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:21,054
She just gave birth
to ralph's baby,
a c- section.


67
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:34,567
Hey.


68
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:37,070
Why don't you try
and get some sleep?


69
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,071
Why?


70
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:40,073
Why?


71
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:46,579
Tomorrow's gonna be
another rough day,
that's why.


72
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:48,581
I don't think i'm gonna
sleep tonight.


73
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:50,083
Is this light
gonna bother you?


74
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,585
No.


75
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:59,092
Goodnight.


76
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:02,095
Tony?


77
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:04,597
I love you, tony.


78
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:07,600
I don't want
anybody getting hurt.


79
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:10,103
Not me,
not the kids,


80
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:11,604
not you.


81
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:14,107
Carmela, i can't do one of
these tearful things


82
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:16,609
till 5:00
in the morning tonight,
i just can't.


83
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:21,114
Not tonight.


84
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:25,618
Did you hear
about ralphie rutaldo?


85
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:27,620
What about him?


86
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:31,624
That brazilian
he keeps on the side?


87
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:33,126
Yeah?


88
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,128
She had a baby.


89
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:37,630
And christopher's
in the hospital,
this is on your mind now?


90
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,632
Maybe it
has to do with


91
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:42,135
the "ck one"
stinking up your shirt
last wednesday night.


92
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:43,636
It's over,
months ago!


93
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:45,138
Yeah, right.


94
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:46,639
"Yeah, right", what?
I told you i cut it off!


95
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,142
Listen tony, if you're gonna
keep doing what you do,


96
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:52,145
at the very least
i want you to get a vasectomy.


97
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:54,147
You want me
to do what?


98
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:55,648
Let's get real,
tony.


99
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:57,650
Do you have any idea
what a bastard child


100
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,152
would do
to this family?


101
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:01,654
You ever think about the shame
your children would feel?


102
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:03,156
You're putting us
all at risk.


103
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:12,665
I had her
tested for aids.


104
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:15,168
What do you
think i am?


105
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:02,215
Code blue icu 3,
code blue icu 3.


106
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:14,727
No, oh my god,
chrissy!


107
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:16,729
He's gonna die!


108
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:18,231
He'll be okay.


109
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:21,234
They said he was
gonna get better!


110
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:23,236
No!


111
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,238
No, let go
of me!


112
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:28,741
No, no!


113
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,251
Yeah.


114
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:41,254
What?


115
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:03,776
How is he?


116
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:07,280
His heart stopped.


117
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,782
They're working
their asses off on him.


118
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:11,284
Alright.


119
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:15,788
Well, we gotta
stay positive, right?


120
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:20,293
We gotta
give him that.


121
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:22,795
Positive vibes only.


122
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:56,329
Gentle and merciful
lord jesus,


123
00:09:56,329 --> 00:10:-1,832
i want to speak to you now
with an open heart,


124
00:10:-1,832 --> 00:10:01,834
with an honest heart.


125
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:05,338
Tonight i ask you
to take my sins


126
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:09,342
and the sins of my family
into your merciful heart.


127
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:12,845
We have chosen this life
in full awareness


128
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:15,348
of the consequences
of our sins.


129
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:18,351
I know that christopher's life
is in your hands...


130
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:23,356
and his fate is your will.


131
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:26,359
I ask you humbly
to spare him.


132
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:29,862
And if it is your will
to spare him,


133
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:33,366
i ask that you deliver him
from blindness


134
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:36,869
and grant him vision.


135
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:40,873
And through this visio
n may he see your love...


136
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:45,878
and gain the strength
to carry on in service
to your mercy.


137
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:54,887
In the name of the father,
the son,


138
00:10:54,887 --> 00:11:00,893
and the holy spirit, amen.


139
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:03,396
Really, if i had
any reservations at all


140
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:04,897
i'd suggest
we move him right away.


141
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:07,400
But this is the best trauma unit
in the tri- state area.


142
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,901
I'm up on
all the ratings.


143
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:12,905
Thanks, hesh.


144
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:17,910
There's no
news yet.


145
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:20,913
Tony, it's
dr. Rueben.


146
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:23,916
Mr. Moltisanti suffered
cardiac and respiratory arrest


147
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,919
due to internal bleeding,
he was resuscitated.


148
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,921
The bleeding was
brought under control


149
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:30,423
and he's now
in stable condition.


150
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:33,426
What was the duration
of the arrest?


151
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:34,927
About a minute.


152
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:36,429
Is he stil
l intubated?


153
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:38,431
They're removing
the ventilator as we speak.


154
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:40,433
What the fuck you two
talking about?


155
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:41,934
The worst is over


156
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:44,937
but he was clinically dead
for about a minute.


157
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:47,940
Doctor, can i go in
and see him?


158
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,941
No, he's gonna
be in post- op


159
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:50,443
for about
four or five hours,


160
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,945
and then he asked
to speak to mr. Gualtieri.


161
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:54,447
Me?


162
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:57,450
He asked twice for
you and mr. Soprano.


163
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:11,964
Christopher.


164
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:14,967
Hey.


165
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:16,469
I'm sorry, t.


166
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:17,970
For what?


167
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:20,973
I know
you're mad at me.


168
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:23,976
What are you talking about?
I'm not mad at you.


169
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:26,979
Nobody's
mad at you.


170
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,483
I'm going to hell, t.


171
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,985
You're not going
anywhere but home.


172
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,488
I crossed over
to the other side.


173
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:37,490
You what?


174
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:41,494
I saw the tunnel
and the white light...


175
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:44,497
and i saw
my father in hell.


176
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:45,998
Get the fuck
out of here.


177
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:48,501
And the bouncer said
that i'd be there too


178
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:50,002
when my time comes.


179
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:51,003
What bouncer?


180
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:54,507
"The emerald piper",
that's our hell.


181
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:57,009
It's an irish bar


182
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:02,014
where it's st. Patrick's day
everyday forever.


183
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:05,017
Mikey palmice
and brendan filone
were there too.


184
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:07,019
They were friends.


185
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,522
Those two guys
hated each other.


186
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:12,024
You gotta relax,
you just need some rest.


187
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,026
They're friends now.


188
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:16,529
They were playing dice
with two roman soldiers


189
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,531
and a bunch
of the irish guys.


190
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:20,032
Doesn't make sense.


191
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:23,035
The irish, they were
winning every roll.


192
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:26,539
And then mikey gave me
a message for both of you.


193
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,040
A message?


194
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,542
Yeah.


195
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:34,046
Yeah, he said...


196
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:37,049
"tell tony and paulie,
3:00."


197
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:39,051
3:00?


198
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:42,054
This fucking morphine drip
, i don't think it's working.


199
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:44,056
I don't feel
a fucking thing.


200
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:46,058
You gotta be
careful with that.


201
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:48,060
That was
all he said?


202
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,061
Who?


203
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:50,563
Mikey,
"3:00"?


204
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,064
Yeah.


205
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:56,068
What was
he wearing?


206
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:59,572
C'mon, let's go,
he needs his rest.


207
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:03,075
He had on a gangster suit,
pinstripe.


208
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:06,078
Old fashioned style.


209
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:08,080
Hey...


210
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,082
that was a dream.


211
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:13,085
Forget about it,
okay?


212
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:19,592
We're gonna
take you home soon.


213
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:23,596
Do they know this kid
likes his chemistry set
a little too much?


214
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:26,599
He's in pain,
what the fuck else
are they gonna do?


215
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:34,106
What time
was mikey hit?


216
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:36,609
How the fuck
do i know?


217
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:38,611
You were there,
weren't you?


218
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:39,612
It was
in the morning, right?


219
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:41,614
11:00, 10:00?


220
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:57,630
Alright, so i cheat--
i used to cheat.


221
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:01,133
I'm not getting spayed,
end of subject.


222
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:03,636
You brought up
the vasectomy,


223
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:05,638
now you don't
want to talk about it.


224
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:11,644
You asked me
what was going on.


225
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:17,650
I saw in the news
about a gangland shooting.


226
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,151
Yeah.


227
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:26,659
Is that your nephew christophe
that you've spoken of before?


228
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:29,161
In the papers they said
he was in critical condition.


229
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:31,163
He's gonna be fine.


230
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:33,666
Have they found the person
that shot him yet?


231
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,668
No...
have you?


232
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:38,170
I'm not trying to pry into
that part of your life.


233
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,673
I know our deal.


234
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:45,177
But i've heard you say before
that you love this young man.


235
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:55,187
Christopher was...


236
00:15:55,688 --> 00:16:01,193
clinically dead
for about a minute.


237
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:04,697
He thinks he had one of those
near death experiences.


238
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:07,700
Says he visited hell.


239
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,202
And they told him
he'd be back permanent.


240
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:12,204
Who's "they"?


241
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:14,707
It's bullshit,
it was a dream,


242
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:16,709
combined with
the morphine.


243
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:19,712
But now he thinks he's gonna
go to hell when he dies.


244
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:21,213
He's all fucked up
over it.


245
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,215
Do you think
he'll go to hell?


246
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:24,717
No.


247
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:32,725
He's not the type
that deserves hell.


248
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:35,227
Who do you
think does?


249
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:36,729
The worst people.


250
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:39,231
The twisted
and demented psychos


251
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:41,233
who kill people
for pleasure.


252
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:43,235
The cannibals,
the degenerate bastards


253
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:44,737
that molest and
torture little kids.


254
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:46,739
They kill babies.


255
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,240
The hitlers,
the pol pots.


256
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,242
Those are the evil fucks
that deserve to die.


257
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:52,244
Not my nephew.


258
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:55,247
What about you?


259
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:57,750
What?


260
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,251
Hell?


261
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:02,755
You been
listening to me?


262
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:04,256
No...


263
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:06,759
for the same reasons.


264
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:09,261
We're soldiers.


265
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:11,263
Soldiers don't
go to hell.


266
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:13,265
It's war.


267
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,768
Soldiers,
they kill other soldiers.


268
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:18,270
We're in a situation


269
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:21,774
where everybody involved
knows the stakes.


270
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:27,279
And if you're gonna
accept those stakes...


271
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:29,782
you gotta
do certain things.


272
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:34,787
It's business,
we're soldiers.


273
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:36,789
We follow codes...


274
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,791
orders.


275
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,794
So does that justify
everything that you do?


276
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:43,295
Excuse me,
let me tell you something.


277
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:45,297
When america opened
the floodgates


278
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:46,799
and let all us
italians in,


279
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,801
what do you think
they were doing it for?


280
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:50,803
Because they were trying
to save us from poverty?


281
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:53,305
No, they did it
because they needed us.


282
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:56,308
They needed us
to build their cities
and dig their subways


283
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:58,310
and to
make'em richer.


284
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:-1,812
The carnegies
and the rockefellers,


285
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:01,814
they needed worker bees
and there we were.


286
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:03,816
But some of us didn't want
to swarm around their hive


287
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:05,317
and lose who we were.


288
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:06,819
We wanted
to stay italian


289
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:09,321
and preserve the things
that meant something to us.


290
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:11,323
Honor, and family,
and loyalty.


291
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:14,326
And some of us wanted
a piece of the action.


292
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:16,829
We weren't educate
d like the americans.


293
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:18,831
But we had the balls
to take what we wanted.


294
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:21,834
Those other fucks,
those other...


295
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:25,337
the j. P. Morgans,
they were crooks
and killers too,


296
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:26,839
but that was
a business, right?


297
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,340
The american way.


298
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:30,342
That might
all be true.


299
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:32,344
But what do
poor italian immigrants


300
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:34,346
have to do with you


301
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:38,350
and what happens every morning
you step out of bed?


302
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,352
What the fuck is this
all of a sudden?


303
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:42,354
I'm just asking
a question.


304
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:44,356
Oh, so you're taking
a stand here now.


305
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:46,358
Huh? You pick here
to make a stand?


306
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:47,860
After all this time,


307
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,362
telling me that
nothing's my fault


308
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:51,864
because of
poor parenting.


309
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:53,866
You pick now to act like
betsy- fucking- ross!


310
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:56,368
When my nephew's
in the fucking hospital!


311
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:58,370
He might not
get out!


312
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:16,388
What, what
3 o'clock again?


313
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:21,894
Quiet.


314
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:27,900
My wind chimes?


315
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,401
Sorry, hon.


316
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:32,404
Don't wake up
my kids, paulie.


317
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:33,906
Motherfucker.


318
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:38,911
Baby, you gotta
relax your thoughts.


319
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:45,417
Whatever christopher saw,
you can't take it personal.


320
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:49,421
Christopher's
a troubled kid.


321
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:54,426
Who knows
what's in his heart?


322
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:56,428
Come.


323
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:57,429
You're right.


324
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:01,433
I need to relax
with this.


325
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:06,939
Let me help you.


326
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:08,440
That is so weird.


327
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:10,442
What the fuck
you saying?


328
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:13,946
3:00?


329
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:16,448
Kenny and i were supposed
to be married at 1:00


330
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:18,951
in the fountainbleu room
at the roman gardens.


331
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:22,955
Mikey and jo- jo had
the bella vista room
booked for 3:00.


332
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:25,457
But the bella vista room
is smaller and has no windows.


333
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,960
A week
before the wedding


334
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,963
mikey saw the bella vista room
and flipped out!


335
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:32,965
He almost killed
the events manager.


336
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:35,467
So mikey and jo- jo
got the fountainbleu


337
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:38,470
and kenny and me wound up
in the bella vista room


338
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:41,473
at 3:00.


339
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,501
Fuck.


340
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:12,004
Just trying to
tidy up the place.


341
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:15,507
Go back to sleep.


342
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:17,509
Tidying up?


343
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,012
How you doing?


344
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:22,514
I'm doing.


345
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:24,016
I'll tell ya...


346
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:29,521
i'm still baffled by
this 3:00 thing though.


347
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:35,027
I wish i had
more for you, paulie,
but that's all he said.


348
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:37,529
Let me ask you
a question.


349
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:39,031
Yeah?


350
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:41,533
That bouncer
that sent you back,


351
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:44,536
did he have horns
on his head?


352
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:46,538
No.


353
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:49,541
He was just some
big irish goon
in old fashioned clothes.


354
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,543
Did anybody there
have horns


355
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:55,047
or buds for horns,
those goat bumps?


356
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:58,050
Paulie, it was
fucking hell, okay?


357
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:01,553
My father said he looses
every hand of cards he plays.


358
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:04,056
And every night
at midnight


359
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:06,558
they whack him the same way
he was whacked in life


360
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:10,562
and it's painful,
night after night.


361
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:13,565
Does that sound like
fucking heaven to you?


362
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:15,067
Was it hot?


363
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:16,568
Yeah...
i don't know.


364
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:18,070
What the fuck?


365
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,572
The heat would've been
the first thing you noticed.


366
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:21,573
Hell is hot.


367
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:23,575
That's never been
disputed by anybody.


368
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:25,577
You didn't
go to hell.


369
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:30,582
You went to purgatory,
my friend.


370
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:32,584
I forgot
all about purgatory.


371
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:34,586
Purgatory,


372
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:39,091
a little detour
on the way to paradise.


373
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:41,593
How long you think
we gotta stay there?


374
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:43,595
That's different
for everybody.


375
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:46,598
You add up all
your mortal sins,


376
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:48,600
multiply that number
by 50,


377
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,602
then you add up
all your venial sins


378
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:53,105
and multiply that
by 25.


379
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:55,107
You add them together,
and that's your sentence.


380
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:57,609
I figure i'm gonna have to do
about 6, 000 years


381
00:22:57,609 --> 00:23:01,113
before i get
accepted into heaven.


382
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:04,116
And 6, 000 years is nothing
in eternity terms.


383
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:06,118
I could do that
standing on my head.


384
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:11,623
It's like a couple
of days here.


385
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:14,126
Was i insensitive?


386
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:19,131
And perhaps,
did i do it deliberately?


387
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:21,633
Do i hate him?


388
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:24,636
How often are you
taking the ativan?


389
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:27,639
Almost every night.


390
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:31,643
And when else?


391
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:35,647
Sunday afternoon
i took one.


392
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:38,650
There's another thing,
i've...


393
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:43,155
i've been drinking...


394
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:45,157
alone.


395
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:47,659
I'm glad
you're telling me.


396
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:58,670
Part of it is that
i'm afraid.


397
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,672
I've told him
my son is at bard.


398
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:05,177
Why did you agree to
continue working with him?


399
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:08,680
I took him back
because i felt it was


400
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:12,684
a professional
and ethical responsibility
to do so.


401
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:16,188
Jennifer, i'm not
challenging your ability


402
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:19,191
or professionalism
, or even your ethics.


403
00:24:19,691 --> 00:24:22,694
Then what are you
challenging?


404
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:25,197
What you hope to
achieve with this man.


405
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:27,699
What do you hope
to achieve with me?


406
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:28,700
No, that's a--


407
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:34,706
a facile analogy.


408
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:38,710
I'm living in a moral
never never land
with this patient.


409
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:43,715
Not wanting to judge,
but to treat.


410
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:46,718
But now...
i've judged.


411
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:51,723
I took a position, goddamnit,
and i'm scared.


412
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:57,729
I feel for you.


413
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:17,249
You're late.


414
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:19,751
Does that
go on my record?


415
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:21,253
I'm talking about
common courtesy here.


416
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:22,754
I got a life
outside of this too.


417
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:23,755
Lucky you.


418
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:25,257
So, what
do you got?


419
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:26,758
I think he knows.


420
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:28,260
Knows what?


421
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,761
Or at least suspects.


422
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:31,263
Who, what?
What are you talking about?


423
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:33,765
He's been looking
at me different,
these glances.


424
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:34,766
Glances?


425
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:36,768
We had sandwiches brought in
the other night,


426
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,770
four with ham, salami,
cappicola,


427
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:41,273
one eggplant, and the other
with tomato and mozzarella.


428
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:42,274
Yeah, okay.


429
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:43,775
That's six total,
there were only five of us.


430
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:46,278
But tony said
he ordered the eggplant,
but i did,


431
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:48,780
and i know
for certain he ordered
the tomato/mozzarella.


432
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,781
Maybe he forgot.


433
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:51,283
No, no,
he never forgets.


434
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:52,784
So, what's
the bottom line?


435
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:54,786
He let me eat the eggplant
and he took the tomato.


436
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:56,288
But there was
a moment.


437
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:57,289
A glance.


438
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:58,790
Yeah,
a fucking glance!


439
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,792
This is simple and
i'm gonna help you out here.


440
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:03,795
You gotta keep in mind
that you're the one
who's different now.


441
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:06,298
You're the one seeing
through different eyes.


442
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:07,799
You're the one
with the new attitude.


443
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:10,802
I know the man
and i see he's the one
who's different with me.


444
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:12,304
The odds
don't favor it.


445
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:14,306
Either way
it doesn't matter.


446
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:15,307
To you.


447
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:17,309
I wasn't the one
selling heroin, okay?


448
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:22,814
And i wasn't the one
who got pinned for it.


449
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:24,316
So what do i do?


450
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:25,817
What do you do?


451
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:27,819
You do everything
you can do do.


452
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:29,821
Do what you do to a girl
that you want to fuck.


453
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:31,823
Make him love you.


454
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:49,341
I'll be back first thing
in the morning.


455
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:52,344
What do you want
for breakfast?


456
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:54,846
You don't wake up
till lunch, ma.


457
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:57,349
Tomorrow i'll get up
early, alright?


458
00:26:57,349 --> 00:27:00,352
How about the peppers and eggs
on the round bread?


459
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:01,353
That sound
s great, ma.


460
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:03,855
Do you need
more time alone, jo?


461
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:05,357
No, i'm ready.


462
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:06,858
Okay, chris.


463
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:08,860
Bye, ma.


464
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:20,372
If you want to sleep, it's okay,
i brought a book.


465
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:22,874
No, i just got up
ten minutes ago.


466
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:24,876
The painkillers
aren't helping?


467
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:29,881
No, they're pretty
fucking good.


468
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:32,884
I want to tell you something,
christopher.


469
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:36,888
The other night
when your heart stopped...


470
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:38,890
i walked the hall
to an empty room


471
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:41,893
and i prayed to jesus
to spare you.


472
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:43,895
And that
if he would spare you


473
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:45,897
i asked that
he grant you vision.


474
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:47,399
Sight.


475
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:50,402
So that you can see
the way to christ clearly.


476
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:52,404
Yeah, so?


477
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:54,906
And he did
spare you.


478
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:57,909
And you saw,
christopher.


479
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:00,412
You saw something,


480
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:03,415
something that none of us
have ever seen.


481
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:11,373
So what did
he say to you?


482
00:28:11,373 --> 00:28:12,374
Who?


483
00:28:12,374 --> 00:28:13,375
Jesus.


484
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:15,377
I didn't see jesus.


485
00:28:15,377 --> 00:28:17,379
Tony said that
you saw jesus smiling


486
00:28:17,379 --> 00:28:19,381
and he took you to see
your father in heaven


487
00:28:19,381 --> 00:28:21,383
and then he said
it wasn't your time.


488
00:28:21,383 --> 00:28:23,385
I was in hell,
carmela.


489
00:28:23,385 --> 00:28:24,386
You what?


490
00:28:24,886 --> 00:28:26,388
My father
was in hell


491
00:28:26,388 --> 00:28:28,890
and they said that's where
i'd go when it's my time.


492
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:32,394
Maybe it was purgatory,
but i don't know.


493
00:28:39,901 --> 00:28:42,904
Then you have to look
at this experience


494
00:28:42,904 --> 00:28:45,907
as an opportunity
to repent...


495
00:28:45,907 --> 00:28:49,411
to change your heart...


496
00:28:49,411 --> 00:28:52,414
to start to walk in
the light of the lord.


497
00:28:52,414 --> 00:28:54,416
You were blessed
by this, christopher.


498
00:28:54,416 --> 00:28:57,419
You were blessed
with a second chance.


499
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:00,422
I don't know,
carmela.


500
00:29:00,422 --> 00:29:01,923
Well, i do know.


501
00:29:02,424 --> 00:29:05,927
And i am gonna pray
like i did the other night


502
00:29:05,927 --> 00:29:08,430
and i'm gonna pray
every day from now on.


503
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:12,934
It is not too late for you,
christopher...


504
00:29:12,934 --> 00:29:16,938
if you pray.


505
00:29:16,938 --> 00:29:22,444
Will you pray?


506
00:29:22,444 --> 00:29:26,948
You just have to
follow me.


507
00:29:26,948 --> 00:29:29,951
In the name of the father,
the son,


508
00:29:29,951 --> 00:29:32,454
and the holy spirit.


509
00:29:46,968 --> 00:29:48,970
How was he?


510
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:49,971
Fine.


511
00:29:49,971 --> 00:29:51,473
The same.


512
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,982
Is there
any news?


513
00:30:00,982 --> 00:30:02,984
No.


514
00:30:12,494 --> 00:30:14,996
So, what?
We're not talking now?


515
00:30:14,996 --> 00:30:17,999
I said what i had
to say, tony.


516
00:30:17,999 --> 00:30:20,001
If you can't
be honest with me,


517
00:30:20,001 --> 00:30:23,004
at least have the balls
to be honest with yourself.


518
00:30:23,004 --> 00:30:24,506
Oh, i got balls.


519
00:30:24,506 --> 00:30:27,008
And as long as i do,
they will remain intact.


520
00:30:27,008 --> 00:30:30,011
If you don't have faith in me,
it's up to you.


521
00:30:30,011 --> 00:30:32,013
You gotta prove it
to yourself first, tony.


522
00:30:32,013 --> 00:30:34,015
To yourself
and god.


523
00:30:34,015 --> 00:30:36,518
You and god,
carmela.


524
00:30:36,518 --> 00:30:38,019
You're only religious
when it suits you.


525
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,522
What is that
supposed to mean?


526
00:30:40,522 --> 00:30:42,023
Come here.


527
00:30:50,031 --> 00:30:52,033
No, no, what is that
supposed to mean?


528
00:30:52,033 --> 00:30:54,035
The pope doesn't even
believe in trojans


529
00:30:54,035 --> 00:30:55,537
and you want me
to get snipped.


530
00:30:55,537 --> 00:30:57,539
Isn't that a little
hypocritical?


531
00:30:57,539 --> 00:31:00,542
Look, tony, i'm thinking o
f my family first, that's all.


532
00:31:00,542 --> 00:31:02,544
Whatever's down here
is god's creation.


533
00:31:02,544 --> 00:31:05,046
Isn't it a sin to undo
the good work he's done?


534
00:31:05,547 --> 00:31:12,053
You should know,
you made a living of it.


535
00:31:12,053 --> 00:31:17,559
You're un- fucking- believable,
you know that?


536
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:23,565
Look what i made
that living for, hmm?


537
00:31:23,565 --> 00:31:25,567
What the fuck
you doing?


538
00:31:25,567 --> 00:31:26,568
You had dinner
an hour ago.


539
00:31:27,068 --> 00:31:29,070
What the fuck are you
doing to yourself?


540
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:33,575
Tony,
leave him alone.


541
00:31:33,575 --> 00:31:36,578
I'm supposed to get a vasectomy
when this is my male heir?


542
00:31:36,578 --> 00:31:38,580
Look at him.


543
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,582
Tony, come back here
and apologize!


544
00:31:51,092 --> 00:31:52,594
You're draggin'
me to hell!


545
00:31:52,594 --> 00:31:54,596
What's the matter,
what's the matter?


546
00:31:54,596 --> 00:31:55,597
You're draggin'
me to hell!


547
00:31:55,597 --> 00:31:57,098
Paulie, paulie,


548
00:31:57,098 --> 00:31:58,600
you had
a nightmare, honey.


549
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,102
Mama, somebody was screaming,
i'm scared.


550
00:32:01,102 --> 00:32:03,605
I know, honey,
it's okay, it's okay.


551
00:32:03,605 --> 00:32:05,607
Uncle paulie
had a bad dream.


552
00:32:05,607 --> 00:32:07,609
Mommy!


553
00:32:07,609 --> 00:32:09,110
Come here,
baby.


554
00:32:09,611 --> 00:32:11,112
It's alright,
it's alright.


555
00:32:11,112 --> 00:32:13,114
It's okay,
sweetheart.


556
00:32:13,114 --> 00:32:14,616
I'm putting them
to bed.


557
00:32:14,616 --> 00:32:17,619
Then i'm going home
to sleep.


558
00:32:17,619 --> 00:32:22,624
I don't need to keep
everyone up with this.


559
00:32:22,624 --> 00:32:26,127
C'mon,
let's go to sleep.


560
00:32:26,127 --> 00:32:28,129
Come talk to me.


561
00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:40,141
How much can you
believe in dreams?


562
00:32:40,141 --> 00:32:42,143
Wait, wrong.


563
00:32:42,143 --> 00:32:44,145
Christopher did not
have a dream.


564
00:32:44,145 --> 00:32:47,148
I dream,
i'd make my peace.


565
00:32:47,148 --> 00:32:49,150
He was dead.


566
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:52,654
Science said he was dead,
science.


567
00:32:52,654 --> 00:32:54,656
You need to
talk to someone


568
00:32:54,656 --> 00:32:57,158
who deals with this kind
of thing professionally.


569
00:32:57,158 --> 00:32:58,660
What kind of thing?


570
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,662
He's in
new york, paulie,


571
00:33:00,662 --> 00:33:03,164
in nyack.


572
00:33:03,164 --> 00:33:05,667
His name is cullen,
he's a psychic.


573
00:33:05,667 --> 00:33:07,669
A psychic, get the fuck
out of here.


574
00:33:07,669 --> 00:33:10,171
He's famous for contacting
dead relatives for people.


575
00:33:10,171 --> 00:33:12,173
He contacted
my dead friend ronnie.


576
00:33:12,173 --> 00:33:13,675
Remember ronnie
with the arm?


577
00:33:13,675 --> 00:33:15,176
Yeah.


578
00:33:15,176 --> 00:33:16,678
He knew all about
the fingers at the elbow


579
00:33:16,678 --> 00:33:18,680
and i didn't
even tell him.


580
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,181
He said,
"johnnie is here."


581
00:33:20,181 --> 00:33:22,183
And i told him
i didn't know any johnnie's,


582
00:33:22,183 --> 00:33:25,687
but then he said,"well, one arm
is shorter than the other.


583
00:33:25,687 --> 00:33:27,689
Does that mean
anything to you?"


584
00:33:28,189 --> 00:33:31,693
Ronnie,
it was ronnie.


585
00:33:31,693 --> 00:33:34,696
Jesus,
fucking creep show.


586
00:33:34,696 --> 00:33:38,199
You got nothing to lose
except the nightmares.


587
00:33:44,205 --> 00:33:47,208
What's up?
Paulie around?


588
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:48,209
No.


589
00:33:48,209 --> 00:33:49,210
Sil?


590
00:33:49,711 --> 00:33:52,213
What the fuck, i'm here,
you talk to me.


591
00:33:52,213 --> 00:33:53,715
You got something?


592
00:33:53,715 --> 00:33:56,217
You better
remember me, man.


593
00:33:56,217 --> 00:33:58,720
Yeah, i will,
now, you got something?


594
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,222
Alright.


595
00:34:01,723 --> 00:34:03,725
Hacklebarney
state park.


596
00:34:03,725 --> 00:34:06,728
You know where that
"george washington
slept- here- house" is?


597
00:34:06,728 --> 00:34:08,730
Up that road there
is a gray house.


598
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:10,231
Bevilaqua's there?


599
00:34:10,732 --> 00:34:12,734
20 bucks, baby.


600
00:34:24,245 --> 00:34:26,748
Are you telling me
that's who you are


601
00:34:26,748 --> 00:34:31,252
or that's who he is?


602
00:34:31,252 --> 00:34:36,257
I see.


603
00:34:36,257 --> 00:34:40,261
Right.


604
00:34:40,261 --> 00:34:44,265
The spirit put
him on hold.


605
00:34:44,265 --> 00:34:47,769
Do you take the name
gregory?


606
00:34:47,769 --> 00:34:48,770
My father.


607
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:50,271
I understand now.


608
00:34:50,772 --> 00:34:54,275
You're gregory,
this is your son.


609
00:34:54,275 --> 00:34:56,277
Is your name
daniel?


610
00:34:56,277 --> 00:34:57,779
Yes.


611
00:34:57,779 --> 00:35:03,785
'Cause i got this image of
daniel in the lion's den.


612
00:35:03,785 --> 00:35:06,287
He says
you found his body.


613
00:35:06,287 --> 00:35:07,789
Oh, my god.


614
00:35:08,289 --> 00:35:09,290
He's sorry.


615
00:35:09,791 --> 00:35:12,293
He knows
how traumatic that was.


616
00:35:12,293 --> 00:35:15,797
He couldn't
take the pain anymore.


617
00:35:23,304 --> 00:35:25,807
Gregory, i'm sorry,
could you repeat that?


618
00:35:35,316 --> 00:35:39,320
He wants you to know
that he was there with you.


619
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:43,324
And that you
should move on.


620
00:35:43,324 --> 00:35:45,326
Yes, go ahead.


621
00:35:54,836 --> 00:36:01,342
What's
the problem?


622
00:36:01,342 --> 00:36:03,344
What the hell's
the matter?


623
00:36:03,344 --> 00:36:06,848
Please, go on.


624
00:36:06,848 --> 00:36:11,352
He can't hurt you,
you don't have to be afraid.


625
00:36:11,352 --> 00:36:13,354
I understand, yes.


626
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,862
I feel your anger.


627
00:36:20,862 --> 00:36:22,864
Who the fuck
are you talking to?


628
00:36:23,364 --> 00:36:24,365
Charles.


629
00:36:24,365 --> 00:36:26,367
Yes, yes,
you have a son.


630
00:36:26,367 --> 00:36:29,370
You're wit
h your son?


631
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:31,873
What the fuck?
I don't got no kids.


632
00:36:31,873 --> 00:36:33,875
Oh, sonny.


633
00:36:33,875 --> 00:36:35,877
Pagano?


634
00:36:35,877 --> 00:36:40,882
Kind spirit,
is your name sonny?


635
00:36:40,882 --> 00:36:42,884
Charles pagano.


636
00:36:43,384 --> 00:36:45,386
How the fuck
do you know that?


637
00:36:45,386 --> 00:36:47,388
He says
he was your first.


638
00:36:47,388 --> 00:36:49,891
But i feel many more.


639
00:36:49,891 --> 00:36:50,391
Hey!


640
00:36:50,892 --> 00:36:52,393
That one's
laughing.


641
00:36:52,393 --> 00:36:53,895
Poison ivy?


642
00:36:53,895 --> 00:36:56,898
He wants to know
if it still itches.


643
00:36:57,398 --> 00:37:00,401
Don't fuck with me,
who you been talking to?


644
00:37:00,401 --> 00:37:02,403
I'm afraid i'm gonna have to
ask you to leave.


645
00:37:02,403 --> 00:37:03,404
Why?


646
00:37:03,905 --> 00:37:05,406
What the fuck
are they saying?


647
00:37:05,907 --> 00:37:07,909
You really want me
to say it?


648
00:37:08,409 --> 00:37:10,912
Fuck you
and this bullshit.


649
00:37:10,912 --> 00:37:12,914
That's what this is,
you know.


650
00:37:12,914 --> 00:37:15,416
Satanic black magic,


651
00:37:15,416 --> 00:37:16,918
sick shit!


652
00:37:16,918 --> 00:37:19,921
I'm asking you
to leave, sir.


653
00:37:19,921 --> 00:37:21,422
Yeah?


654
00:37:21,422 --> 00:37:23,424
Fucking queers!


655
00:37:37,438 --> 00:37:42,944
When i made my appointment
, i gave the name ted hughes.


656
00:37:43,444 --> 00:37:45,446
Did you call
from your house?


657
00:37:45,446 --> 00:37:47,949
I'm not a moron, t.


658
00:37:48,449 --> 00:37:51,452
I knew this might
be a scam.


659
00:37:51,452 --> 00:37:56,958
So i called him
from a pathmark.


660
00:37:56,958 --> 00:37:59,460
There's
no denying it.


661
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,963
I'm dragging a bunch of
fucking ghouls around with me


662
00:38:01,963 --> 00:38:05,967
and mikey's
their fucking ringleader.


663
00:38:05,967 --> 00:38:07,969
Alright...


664
00:38:07,969 --> 00:38:10,471
paulie...
think about it.


665
00:38:10,471 --> 00:38:12,974
You whacked a bunch of
heavy hitters in your time,


666
00:38:13,474 --> 00:38:15,476
now, you think they're gonna
all join together


667
00:38:15,476 --> 00:38:16,978
and follow
that prick mikey?


668
00:38:16,978 --> 00:38:18,980
How can you
just sit there?


669
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,982
He warned you
about 3:00 too.


670
00:38:20,982 --> 00:38:22,483
I don't believe
any of this shit.


671
00:38:22,984 --> 00:38:26,487
It doesn't mean
a fucking thing to me.


672
00:38:27,989 --> 00:38:29,991
I was ready to write
the whole thing off


673
00:38:29,991 --> 00:38:32,493
until this psychic mentioned
little sonny pagano.


674
00:38:32,493 --> 00:38:34,996
But, that?
I don't know.


675
00:38:34,996 --> 00:38:37,999
I did this guy
over 30 years ago, t.


676
00:38:37,999 --> 00:38:40,001
How the fuck
did he know that?


677
00:38:40,001 --> 00:38:42,003
Does he know where
matt bevilaqua is?


678
00:38:42,003 --> 00:38:44,505
Did you ask the fucking
ghostbuster that?


679
00:38:44,505 --> 00:38:47,508
'Cause we're out there
breaking our ass
trying to find this kid,


680
00:38:47,508 --> 00:38:49,510
and you're up there
fucking around in nyack.


681
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:53,014
He deals only
with the dead.


682
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,022
You eat steak?


683
00:39:01,022 --> 00:39:03,024
What the fuck
you talking about?


684
00:39:03,024 --> 00:39:06,027
If you were in india,
you would go to hell for that.


685
00:39:06,027 --> 00:39:08,029
I'm not in india,
what do i give a fuck?


686
00:39:08,029 --> 00:39:10,031
That's what i'm trying
to tell you.


687
00:39:10,531 --> 00:39:12,533
None of this shit
means a goddamn thing.


688
00:39:36,557 --> 00:39:38,059
I'm not hungry.


689
00:39:38,059 --> 00:39:40,561
You mind if i sit here
while i eat?


690
00:40:03,084 --> 00:40:06,087
I'm sorry for talking to you
the way i did.


691
00:40:06,087 --> 00:40:09,590
It's okay.


692
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:12,593
No...
it's not.


693
00:40:12,593 --> 00:40:15,096
I was wrong.


694
00:40:15,096 --> 00:40:19,600
And i hope you know
i didn't mean it.


695
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,603
I said it'cause
all the anger and frustration


696
00:40:23,104 --> 00:40:30,111
of the last few days
built up inside me and exploded.


697
00:40:30,111 --> 00:40:32,613
There's no excuse
for that.


698
00:40:32,613 --> 00:40:36,117
I gotta learn to
control my emotions
around the people i love.


699
00:40:42,123 --> 00:40:44,125
I think
you're the same way.


700
00:40:44,625 --> 00:40:46,627
I think,
your feelings,


701
00:40:47,128 --> 00:40:49,130
you keep'em inside,


702
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:55,136
and you and me,
we react without thinking.


703
00:40:55,636 --> 00:40:58,639
That's why i get mad at you,
i see myself in you.


704
00:41:04,645 --> 00:41:08,649
I couldn't ask

00:41:14,655 --> 00:41:19,160
Thanks.


707
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,662
Want a piece of pizza?


708
00:41:34,675 --> 00:41:37,178

709
00:41:37,678 --> 00:41:39,180
Pussy's

710
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,182
He says
it's urgent.


711
00:41:56,197 --> 00:41:58,199
I been calling you all
over the fucking place.


712
00:41:58,199 --> 00:41:59,700
I'll be
right there.


713
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:04,205
What's going on?


714
00:42:04,205 --> 00:42:06,207
Nothing.


715
00:42:21,722 --> 00:42:24,225
He's way the fuck out
near morristown,


716
00:42:24,725 --> 00:42:26,227
in hacklebarney
state park.


717
00:42:26,727 --> 00:42:30,231
Over by that "george washington
slept- here- house"?


718
00:42:30,231 --> 00:42:34,735
Yeah.


719
00:42:35,236 --> 00:42:36,737
Give me one.


720
00:42:36,737 --> 00:42:39,240
You don't
have to do this.


721
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:44,245
Furio and me
are on it.


722
00:42:44,245 --> 00:42:46,247
I want to do this.


723
00:42:46,247 --> 00:42:49,250
Good.


724
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:50,751
Cut furio loose.


725
00:42:51,252 --> 00:42:53,254
Three's a crowd.


726
00:43:17,278 --> 00:43:19,280
Why don't you just
take it easy?


727
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:21,782
We just want
to talk to you.


728
00:43:21,782 --> 00:43:24,285
That's all.


729
00:43:24,285 --> 00:43:30,291
It wasn't me,
it was sean,
just sean.


730
00:43:30,791 --> 00:43:32,293
You're shaking.


731
00:43:32,293 --> 00:43:35,796
You're gonna fucking kill me
for something i didn't do.


732
00:43:41,302 --> 00:43:43,804
Don't you think we could've
killed you already,


733
00:43:43,804 --> 00:43:46,307
if we
wanted you dead.


734
00:43:46,307 --> 00:43:47,808
Relax.


735
00:43:48,309 --> 00:43:50,311
We just want
to talk to you.


736
00:43:50,311 --> 00:43:51,312
Tony, it was sean!


737
00:43:51,812 --> 00:43:53,814
You got to believe me,
it was sean, he got nuts!


738
00:43:53,814 --> 00:43:56,317
He said we're being pissed on
and disrespected


739
00:43:56,317 --> 00:43:58,319
and that we should
score points with richie.


740
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:02,823
But i told him rome wasn't
built in one day!


741
00:44:03,324 --> 00:44:09,830
Anything tony, i'll tell you
anything you want to know.


742
00:44:10,331 --> 00:44:11,832
What did
richie say?


743
00:44:12,333 --> 00:44:14,335
It nothing to do with richie,
he didn't ask for it.


744
00:44:14,835 --> 00:44:16,337
He got mad
when i told him.


745
00:44:16,837 --> 00:44:21,842
Sean did it on spec.


746
00:44:21,842 --> 00:44:22,843
Alright.


747
00:44:23,344 --> 00:44:24,845
Come here.


748
00:44:24,845 --> 00:44:26,847
Come here,
c'mon.


749
00:44:32,353 --> 00:44:35,356
Are you sure nobody else
was involved?


750
00:44:35,356 --> 00:44:37,858
Take a minute,
think it over.


751
00:44:37,858 --> 00:44:40,361
It was sea
n all the way.


752
00:44:46,367 --> 00:44:48,369
Alright.


753
00:44:48,369 --> 00:44:52,873
You're a good kid.


754
00:44:53,374 --> 00:44:55,376
I'm thirsty.


755
00:44:55,376 --> 00:44:59,380
See if we got
something to drink.


756
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:01,382
What can
i get you?


757
00:45:01,382 --> 00:45:03,884
You want a fanta,
something like that?


758
00:45:23,404 --> 00:45:24,905
How is that?


759
00:45:24,905 --> 00:45:27,408
I mean, you sure
you want a diet drink?


760
00:45:27,408 --> 00:45:30,411
You don't want something
with some sugar in it?


761
00:45:30,411 --> 00:45:32,413
There's only diet.


762
00:45:32,913 --> 00:45:38,919
It's good.


763
00:45:38,919 --> 00:45:44,925
You finished?


764
00:45:44,925 --> 00:45:46,427
Thank you, t.


765
00:45:46,927 --> 00:45:48,429
'Cause that
sugarless motherfucker,


766
00:45:48,429 --> 00:45:50,931
it's the last fucking drink
you're ever gonna have.


767
00:45:50,931 --> 00:45:52,933
I swear to god,
mommy!


768
00:45:53,434 --> 00:45:56,437
Mommy, please, tony,
please!


769
00:46:26,967 --> 00:46:29,970
23 years of donations
to your parish


770
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:31,972
and this is what
this guy sees hanging over me?


771
00:46:32,473 --> 00:46:34,475
You should've never gone
to a psychic.


772
00:46:34,475 --> 00:46:36,477
It's divination,
it's the devil.


773
00:46:36,477 --> 00:46:39,980
They're completely
unsanctioned by the church.


774
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:42,483
Psychics are
heretics and thieves


775
00:46:42,483 --> 00:46:44,485
who practice witchcraft.


776
00:46:44,485 --> 00:46:47,488
There's no validity
to anything he told you.


777
00:46:47,488 --> 00:46:49,990
Your problem's
a spiritual matter.


778
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:50,991
Maybe.


779
00:46:51,492 --> 00:46:52,993
But irregardless,


780
00:46:52,993 --> 00:46:55,996
i should've had immunity
to all of this shit.


781
00:46:55,996 --> 00:46:58,999
I should've been covered
by my donations.


782
00:46:58,999 --> 00:47:01,502
When the organ needed
a reed job who was there?


783
00:47:01,502 --> 00:47:04,004
When the priest
and the alter boys
needed new whites,


784
00:47:04,004 --> 00:47:06,507
who picked up
the tab?


785
00:47:06,507 --> 00:47:08,008
You should've
come to me first


786
00:47:08,008 --> 00:47:10,511
and none of this
would've happened.


787
00:47:10,511 --> 00:47:12,513
But don't worry, paul,
i'm here.


788
00:47:12,513 --> 00:47:14,014
I can help you.


789
00:47:14,014 --> 00:47:16,016
It's too late.


790
00:47:16,016 --> 00:47:19,019
You've been slacking off on me
and you left me unprotected.


791
00:47:19,019 --> 00:47:21,021
I'm cutting you off
for good.


792
00:47:21,021 --> 00:47:23,524
You ain't never gonna see
another dime from me.


793
00:48:05,065 --> 00:48:07,568
A rich man and a poor man
got the same wedding anniversary


794
00:48:08,068 --> 00:48:10,571
and every year they meet
on madison avenue


795
00:48:10,571 --> 00:48:12,573
when their shopping
for their wives.


796
00:48:12,573 --> 00:48:15,075
So the poor man
says to the rich man,


797
00:48:15,075 --> 00:48:16,577
"what'd you buy
your wife this year?"


798
00:48:16,577 --> 00:48:18,579
He says,"i got her
a huge diamond ring


799
00:48:18,579 --> 00:48:20,080
and a brand new
mercedes."


800
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,082
Poor man says,"what'd you
get her both for?"


801
00:48:22,583 --> 00:48:23,584
Rich man says,


802
00:48:23,584 --> 00:48:25,586
"if she don't
like the diamond ring


803
00:48:26,086 --> 00:48:31,592
she can bring it back
in the mercedes
and still be happy."


804
00:48:31,592 --> 00:48:33,093
Rich man says
to the poor man,


805
00:48:33,093 --> 00:48:35,095
"what'd you get
your wife this year?"


806
00:48:35,095 --> 00:48:37,598
He says, i got her
a pair of slippers and dildo."


807
00:48:37,598 --> 00:48:40,601
Rich man says,"what'd you
get her a pair of slippers
and a dildo for?"


808
00:48:40,601 --> 00:48:42,102
And the poor man says,


809
00:48:42,102 --> 00:48:49,610
"she don't like the slippers
she can go fuck herself."


810
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:53,113
Can i get
another heineken?


811
00:48:53,113 --> 00:48:56,116
Remember the first time
you brought me here?


812
00:48:56,116 --> 00:48:57,618
Yeah,
i remember.


813
00:48:57,618 --> 00:49:01,622
Popped my cherry
that night.


814
00:49:01,622 --> 00:49:04,124
Yeah, seems like
old times.


815
00:49:14,635 --> 00:49:16,136
Puss.


816
00:49:21,141 --> 00:49:24,645
You believe in god?


817
00:49:24,645 --> 00:49:27,648
Yeah, i do, ton',
absolutely.


818
00:49:28,148 --> 00:49:31,151
Works in very mysterious ways
his wonders to perform,


819
00:49:31,151 --> 00:49:32,653
but no doubt,


820
00:49:32,653 --> 00:49:37,157
he's been
very good to me.


821
00:49:37,157 --> 00:49:38,158
Salut.


822
00:50:00,681 --> 00:50:04,685
Hi.


823
00:50:04,685 --> 00:50:07,187
Hey.


824
00:50:07,187 --> 00:50:09,189
How you doing?


825
00:50:09,189 --> 00:50:13,193
Fine.


826
00:50:13,193 --> 00:50:18,198
You?


827
00:50:18,198 --> 00:50:21,201
Good.


828
00:50:21,201 --> 00:50:22,703
Yeah?


829
00:51:05,245 --> 00:51:07,748
I've been thinking...


830
00:51:14,254 --> 00:51:19,760
what?


831
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,261
I'll do it.


832
00:51:27,768 --> 00:51:30,771
You'll do what?


833
00:51:30,771 --> 00:51:32,272
Snip- snip.


834
00:51:38,779 --> 00:51:44,785
I don't want you
to do it, tony.


835
00:51:44,785 --> 00:51:46,286
No, you want me
to do it.


836
00:51:46,286 --> 00:51:48,288
And now
i want to do it.


837
00:51:48,288 --> 00:51:49,790
So...


838
00:51:49,790 --> 00:51:52,292
we'll do it.


839
00:51:58,799 --> 00:52:01,802
I started thinking...


840
00:52:01,802 --> 00:52:06,807
meadow is
leaving soon...


841
00:52:06,807 --> 00:52:11,311
and i may want to
have another baby.


842
00:52:11,812 --> 00:52:15,816
Maybe.


843
00:52:15,816 --> 00:52:18,819
What, are you trying
to drive me fucking crazy?


844
00:52:18,819 --> 00:52:21,822
What's behind
all this?


845
00:52:21,822 --> 00:52:23,824
Ralphie rutald
o and his goomar,


846
00:52:23,824 --> 00:52:25,325
then the vasectomy
, then no vasectomy,


847
00:52:25,325 --> 00:52:28,829
and now this, huh?


848
00:52:28,829 --> 00:52:34,334
Now you don't
want me cut?


849
00:52:34,334 --> 00:52:38,839
Tony...


850
00:52:38,839 --> 00:52:41,341
all i want
is you.


851
00:52:41,341 --> 00:52:47,848
That's all
i have ever wanted.


852
00:52:47,848 --> 00:52:52,853
And i want you to be true
and to be mine.


853
00:52:52,853 --> 00:52:56,356
I want you

00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,863
If you're not gonna
believe me, then fine.

00:53:02,863 --> 00:53:07,367

858
00:53:07,367 --> 00:53:11,872
I don't know.


859
00:53:11,872 --> 00:53:14,374
