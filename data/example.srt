eat the grass...

Did he show you the shadows

00:18:16,972 --> 00:18:20,475
There's no hyenas.
You just chased them all off.

220
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,563
Just to the watering hole
and no further.

221
00:18:25,898 --> 00:18:27,774
And stay downwind.

Whoa. How far is it?

237
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:01,934
Not far. Just to the shadows.

00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,977
But don't worry,
everyone's been there.

239

We've never been
that far before.

- What if we get lost?
- Relax, Nala.

241
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:11,151
I patrolled the entire kingdom
this morning with my dad.

242
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:12,778
There's nothing to worry about.

243

Well, there is one thing.

244
00:19:15,906 --> 00:19:18,450
We have an imminent threat.
Something is approaching.

245

Oh, wait, scratch that.
That's my own shadow.

250
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:32,548
to see the future king
with his future queen.

"future queen"?

Nala and I are friends.

And besides,
she's afraid of rhinos!

We are never
getting married, Zazu.

268

With an attitude like that,

269
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,210
I'm afraid you'll be
a pretty pathetic king.

that I'm dealing with, right?

are my problems?

668

But we can help him. We're
in a position to help him.

669

(GROANS) So, how are you,
in as few words as possible?

670

we can do, right?

the past.

that's a lot to ask...

676

That's a biggie.

TIMON: ...if I'm being honest.

678
00:54:03,702 --> 00:54:05,245
I mean, change the past?
It already happened.

679
00:54:05,412 --> 00:54:07,080
Yeah, so you can't change that.

680
00:54:07,247 --> 00:54:08,540
But you know
what you can change?

681
00:54:09,541 --> 00:54:11,585
The future.
That's our specialty.

682
00:54:11,752 --> 00:54:13,086
Kind of our thing.

683
00:54:13,253 --> 00:54:15,672
How can you change something
that hasn't happened?

684
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:17,925
Well, to change the future,

685
00:54:18,008 --> 00:54:19,468
you gotta put your past
behind you.

686
00:54:19,635 --> 00:54:20,636
Way behind.

687
00:54:20,719 --> 00:54:23,013
Look, kid, bad things happen

688
00:54:23,096 --> 00:54:25,265
and you can't do anything
about it, right?

689
00:54:25,349 --> 00:54:26,350
Right.

690
00:54:26,475 --> 00:54:29,061
Wrong! When the world
turns its back on you...

691
00:54:29,228 --> 00:54:31,021
you turn your back on the world!

692
00:54:31,605 --> 00:54:33,398
And only embrace what's next!

693
00:54:33,565 --> 00:54:35,442
And turn the "what"
into "so what?"

694
00:54:35,609 --> 00:54:37,736
Well, that's not
what I was taught.

695

Well, then maybe
you need a new lesson.

- Why don't we count together?

- Nice.
- Boom!

Have you thought
about feeding that thing?

not eat us!
