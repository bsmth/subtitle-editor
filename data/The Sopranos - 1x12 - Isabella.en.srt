1
00:01:47,457 --> 00:01:50,960
Junior, hey.
Jimmy,
how you doin', kid?

2
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,463
How many of these things
we gotta go to?

3
00:01:53,463 --> 00:01:56,466
Brendan filone's mother
at the kid's funeral,
the way she carried on.

4
00:01:56,466 --> 00:01:58,968
Fuckin' manners.
I just want you to know,

5
00:01:59,469 --> 00:02:01,971
i always thought you had
that right too, you know?

6
00:02:02,472 --> 00:02:05,975
Jimmy, let me tell you
something. Don't worry
about what i know.

7
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:21,107
I was just over
to tony's house.
Oh, yeah?

8
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:23,610
How was he?

9
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,614
He looked, uh, tired.

10
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:30,250
Maybe he's
got hypoglycemia.

11
00:02:30,366 --> 00:02:33,119
- Maybe he's depressed.
- What's he got to be
depressed about?

12
00:02:33,503 --> 00:02:36,256
He talked to me
about it.

13
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:38,508
- Depression?
- Well--

14
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:40,877
what the fuck
do you know
about depression?

15
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,012
Nothin'.
I'm just sayin', that's all.

16
00:02:43,012 --> 00:02:45,515
But he's sleeping all the time.
He's not taking care
of himself.

17
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,884
A lot of top guys
had dark moods.

18
00:02:47,884 --> 00:02:50,887
That winston churchill,
he drank a quart of brandy
before breakfast.

19
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:54,891
And, uh, napoleon,
he was a moody fuck too.

20
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,531
- Am i nuts? -

21
00:03:01,531 --> 00:03:05,034
a day at the mall in mules
and i'll be crippled for life.

22
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:14,043
Oh, i told lilliana to put
some giambott' in the microwave
for when you get up.

23
00:03:15,545 --> 00:03:17,547
Tony, how are you fixed
for sweat socks?

24
00:03:17,547 --> 00:03:20,533
We're gonna be right by
the sports authority.

25
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:24,470
Tony?

26
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:29,475
Tony, i know
you're in there.
I know you hear me.

27
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:32,478
Will you let me sleep?
Does your lady therapist
know about this?

28
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:34,981
Maybe you need
more medication.

29
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:37,984
She already got me
on lithium and prozac.
What else you want?

30
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:41,487
Aromatherapy, something.
This is not normal,

31
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:44,490
for a healthy adult male
to take to bed like this.

32
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:48,861
I got a lot on my mind.
Really?
Well, move over then.

33
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,365
Those indictments are
hangin' over my head too.

34
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:56,269
Plus i got the roots
in the pipe to the street.

35
00:03:56,269 --> 00:04:00,757
My best friend pussy
has disappeared. He's
probably fuckin' dead, okay?

36
00:04:00,757 --> 00:04:03,760
This downturn started long
before pussy bompensiero
disappeared.

37
00:04:08,298 --> 00:04:11,801
If you want me, i will be
at the paramus mall...

38
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:16,222
getting your son a suit
to wear to his first formal.

39
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,984
Carmela, come on!
Sunlight is good
for people, tony.

40
00:04:27,984 --> 00:04:31,120
In alaska, they wear these
little light hats in the winter
so they don't get depressed.

41
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,582
Sorry, junior.

42
00:06:39,582 --> 00:06:42,085
The jackson
street bridge was out.

43
00:06:42,085 --> 00:06:46,589
If you say you're gonna
be someplace, be someplace.
Sorry.

44
00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:48,591
Junior,
you all right?

45
00:06:49,092 --> 00:06:51,594
Porkchop boy was here,
that fuckin' altieri.

46
00:06:53,596 --> 00:06:55,598
Runnin' his mouth about
the brendan filone hit.

47
00:06:56,099 --> 00:06:59,602
Is that what him and my other
capos talk about behind my back
at the fuckin' old folks home?

48
00:06:59,602 --> 00:07:02,105
Well, the
meeting's adjourned
at the green grove.

49
00:07:02,105 --> 00:07:06,109
Chucky and i spoke
to donnie p. , and the thing,
it's happenin' tomorrow.

50
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,363
That quick? Good.
Yeah.

51
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:13,366
Black guys.
It'll never lead back.

52
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:15,868
Think they got
apisciatoio
in this place?

53
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:22,375
Look at her like that.
Mariolina gave me
my first hand job--

54
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:25,995
me and vincent maniscalooo
in the alley behind
the chicken market.

55
00:07:25,995 --> 00:07:29,882
- Junior.
- God, what am i saying
at this poor woman's wake?

56
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:33,886
I just wanted to let you know
so you didn't have to worry.

57
00:07:34,003 --> 00:07:37,507
- Everything's taken care of
about tony.
- Let's go.

58
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,643
When i was a little kid,
no older than that,

59
00:07:40,643 --> 00:07:43,646
i always used to wonder
why nobody collected
prayer cards...

60
00:07:43,646 --> 00:07:46,149
like they collect
baseball cards.

61
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:50,403
Thousands of bucks
for honus wagner...

62
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,905
and jack shit for jesus.

63
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:56,409
It's going down
in a newsstand that he goes to
by the medical center.

64
00:07:56,526 --> 00:08:00,530
Where he spills his guts
on some fuckin'
shrink's carpet.

65
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:04,033
Junior, these guys
are very, very good.

66
00:08:04,534 --> 00:08:06,035
Donnie paduana did time
with them at rahway.

67
00:08:06,536 --> 00:08:08,538
And i was very specific.

68
00:08:08,538 --> 00:08:12,542
He's not gonna suffer.
He's gonna have an open casket.
I promise.

69
00:08:12,542 --> 00:08:16,045
Enough! I don't wanna
hear any more.

70
00:08:16,045 --> 00:08:18,931
Jesus, michael,
if i delegate,
i delegate.

71
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:22,435
Is that what time it is?

72
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:28,057
There is absolutely nothing
on the street about
the big guy, t, anywhere.

73
00:08:31,561 --> 00:08:34,063
I went to see
his family.

74
00:08:34,063 --> 00:08:39,068
Angela doesn't know shit,
or she deserves an
academy fuckin' award.

75
00:08:39,068 --> 00:08:41,571
His goomah either.

76
00:08:41,571 --> 00:08:44,574
I don't wanna hear
no more talkin' about pussy.

77
00:08:45,074 --> 00:08:49,078
Mr. Tony,
let me take that robe
and wash it for you.

78
00:08:49,078 --> 00:08:51,581
Did i ask you
to take the robe?

79
00:08:57,086 --> 00:09:01,090
Jimmy altieri
was in the bing.

80
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:04,093
Can't even look him
in the face anymore.

81
00:09:04,093 --> 00:09:07,096
If he's wired,
it's doing jack shit
for the government...

82
00:09:07,096 --> 00:09:11,100
'cause all we feed him now
is deliberate bullshit
till we can--

83
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,605
you know.
Don't do nothin'
about jimmy.

84
00:09:15,605 --> 00:09:18,107
I don't even know
if he's the guy
that flipped.

85
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:23,112
I don't know nothin'
no more.

86
00:09:26,115 --> 00:09:29,619
Pussy probably freaked out
and he's lammin' it,
that's all.

87
00:09:33,623 --> 00:09:36,125
How many times
do i gotta say it?

88
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,883
You goin' somewhere, t?
You want me to drive you?
No.

89
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:48,137
- I usually drive you.
- I'm goin' downstairs.

90
00:09:48,137 --> 00:09:50,273
What are you gonna do?

91
00:09:50,273 --> 00:09:52,775
I'm gonna get my pants outta
the fuckin' dryer, okay?

92
00:10:28,177 --> 00:10:30,680
Hello.
Hi.

93
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,183
Is this yours?
I found it in the yard.

94
00:10:34,183 --> 00:10:37,320
Oh, no. Really?

95
00:10:38,821 --> 00:10:40,823
I thought
the cusamanos were away.

96
00:10:41,324 --> 00:10:44,827
Yeah, they went
in bermuda to play golf.

97
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:48,948
You're from italy,
aren't you?

98
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:52,451
My english is pitiful.
No.

99
00:10:52,835 --> 00:10:54,837
You speak very good.

100
00:10:54,837 --> 00:10:57,707
Your english is better
than my italian.

101
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,710
"Principles of oral surgery"?

102
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:06,215
I'm a student. I'm here
as a part of an exchange program
between our two countries.

103
00:11:06,349 --> 00:11:10,853
Boy, if my dentist looked
like you, i'd stay awake
during a root canal.

104
00:11:12,355 --> 00:11:15,358
All right.
I'll, uh-- i'll let you study.

105
00:11:16,859 --> 00:11:20,363
Thank you for bring me--

106
00:11:20,363 --> 00:11:22,365
i don't know
how to say in english.

107
00:11:22,365 --> 00:11:24,867
Well, that makes two of us.

108
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,739
Bye.

109
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:20,039
Remember,
they don't want
nothin' above the neck.

110
00:12:26,929 --> 00:12:29,298
Whoa.

111
00:12:33,936 --> 00:12:36,689
Doughnuts? No wonder
he can't lose weight.

112
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:39,191
Where's he goin' now?

113
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:45,698
- Yo, sir? Excuse me.
- What?

114
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:47,700
Could you pull forward
so we can get out?

115
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:50,953
Give me a minute.
Police department.

116
00:12:50,953 --> 00:12:52,955
Where's your badge?

117
00:12:52,955 --> 00:12:55,324
Man, i said move
this piece of shit
fuckin' now!

118
00:12:55,324 --> 00:12:58,828
Get the fuck
outta my face.

119
00:13:02,331 --> 00:13:06,335
Shit!
We gonna have to waste
this motherfucker too?

120
00:13:06,335 --> 00:13:09,588
Let soprano get his doughnuts.
We'll pop him when he gets out.

121
00:13:28,491 --> 00:13:33,112
- Where's he goin'?
- Let's see if he left his
motherfuckin' keys in the car.

122
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:45,124
Man, this is fucked up.

123
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:55,634
No. No.

124
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:58,637
Jesus. You make a left
at the stop sign.

125
00:13:59,021 --> 00:14:01,524
You must be lookin'
straight at us. What are
you, fuckin' ray charles?

126
00:14:01,524 --> 00:14:05,144
Jesus christ!
How the hell could
it not have gone down?

127
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:07,146
I know, junior.
I'm sorry.

128
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,281
Some civilian got in the way.
Donnie will explain it to us.

129
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:13,035
- He's around the corner.
He got lost.
- I wanted it to be over.

130
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:16,155
I know.
Junior, mints?

131
00:14:26,549 --> 00:14:28,551
We've been standin'
around here forever.

132
00:14:28,551 --> 00:14:33,422
You don't think we got
better things to do?
What the fuck, man?

133
00:14:34,924 --> 00:14:37,426
They'll do it
fuckin' tomorrow.
My personal guarantee.

134
00:14:37,426 --> 00:14:40,429
Let me tell you something,
donnie. If they don't,

135
00:14:40,563 --> 00:14:43,566
some hikers are gonna
find your personal guarantee
rolled up in a tube...

136
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:45,184
and shoved up your ass.

137
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:48,687
Mike, they got blocked in.
There were witnesses.

138
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:50,689
Tomorrow.
What did i just say?

139
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:54,693
I already talked to them.
I realize it's urgent.

140
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:57,696
I hear tony s's own mother
wants him popped.

141
00:14:57,696 --> 00:15:01,200
Who the fuck told you that?
- It was just a joke, right? -

142
00:15:01,584 --> 00:15:04,086
you think that's funny,
a guy's own mother?
Okay, okay.

143
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:06,956
Tomorrow.
Fuckin' "a"!

144
00:15:09,592 --> 00:15:11,594
All right.

145
00:15:20,603 --> 00:15:24,106
I don't like it.
This fuckin' guy's big mouth.

146
00:15:24,106 --> 00:15:26,609
Nah, he's okay.
I don't like it.

147
00:15:27,109 --> 00:15:29,612
Next he'll be makin' jokes
about me.

148
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:34,733
Chucky, tell him
to wait a minute.

149
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:38,737
Yo, donnie,
hold on a minute.

150
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,244
Hey, donnie. Sorry.

151
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:11,353
- Are you still taking
the lithium?
- Lithium, prozac.

152
00:16:12,855 --> 00:16:16,859
When is it gonna end?
We're tryin' to give
a jolt to your system.

153
00:16:16,859 --> 00:16:20,362
Give it a, uh--
a little kick start.

154
00:16:20,362 --> 00:16:23,365
Why don't you kick me
in the fuckin' head?
What you're going through...

155
00:16:23,365 --> 00:16:25,367
is very painful,
i know that.

156
00:16:25,367 --> 00:16:28,120
You get stabbed in the ribs,
that's painful.

157
00:16:28,504 --> 00:16:32,124
This shit--
i don't feel nothin'.

158
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:34,126
Nothin'.

159
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:37,129
Dead. Empty.

160
00:16:41,383 --> 00:16:43,519
What else?

161
00:16:46,522 --> 00:16:49,775
- What?
- What were you just
thinkin' about then?

162
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:53,779
This gorgeous
piece of cus.

163
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:57,783
It's next door to cusamano's.
She's stayin' there
while they're away.

164
00:16:58,033 --> 00:17:02,905
- So you do feel something.
- Don't split hairs with me,
'cause i've had it with you.

165
00:17:02,905 --> 00:17:07,793
Like fuckin' king midas
in reverse here. Everything
i touch turns to shit.

166
00:17:08,043 --> 00:17:10,045
I'm not a husband
to my wife.

167
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:12,664
I'm not a father
to my kids.

168
00:17:12,915 --> 00:17:15,918
I'm not a friend
to my friends.
I'm nothin'.

169
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,923
I don't even know
why i come here.

170
00:17:22,925 --> 00:17:25,427
Nothin' else to do,
i guess.

171
00:17:25,427 --> 00:17:29,181
Do you think it would help
if you went someplace
so you could rest up a while?

172
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:32,818
- Oh, you mean like vegas?
- No, not vegas.

173
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:35,687
Someplace where you
could be looked after.
Like a hospital?

174
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:40,692
- With the padded rooms
and the straitjackets?
- No. No straitjackets.

175
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:42,694
A residential
treatment center.

176
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:45,197
You got any idea what
my life would be worth...

177
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:48,700
if certain people found out
i checked into
a laughing academy?

178
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,838
- Your life is boxing us in.
- Well, i'll take a gun, and
i'll blow my fuckin' head off.

179
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:56,208
If that's what you're saying,
then i think youshould
be hospitalized.

180
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:59,711
Oh, yeah? Well, you get
a couple of guys, you come
to my house, you try it.

181
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:04,349
All right.

182
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:08,470
I'm gonna push the prozac
to 60 milligrams.

183
00:18:09,471 --> 00:18:11,723
Sure. Why not?

184
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:26,738
Hey, is that you?

185
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,743
Ciao.
Look who's here.

186
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:35,747
I was just talkin'
about you. No kiddin'.
What are you doin' here?

187
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:39,251
Oh, i have the class
in gum graftingalla scuola.
I just finish.

188
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:43,255
Let me ask you.
This sandwich,

189
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:45,257
it says it's a hero.

190
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:47,259
Why do they call
a sandwich hero?

191
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:50,762
You don't wanna
eat that. No.
No?

192
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:53,265
Come on.
What's your name?

193
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:56,768
Isabella.
I'm tony.

194
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:59,771
You never went
in italy?
No.

195
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:02,774
Why not?
You don't want to go?

196
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:05,277
I guess i just
never got off my ass.

197
00:19:05,527 --> 00:19:07,913
- Excuse my french.
- Your french?

198
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:10,782
- It's an expression.
- Oh.

199
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:17,039
And where are your people from?
Wait a minute. Don't tell me.

200
00:19:21,043 --> 00:19:23,295
- Avellino?
- How'd you know that?

201
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:25,681
I didn't.
I guess it.

202
00:19:25,681 --> 00:19:28,684
You look like this guy
from there.

203
00:19:28,684 --> 00:19:32,804
He came after
the "hearthquake" to repair--

204
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:35,807
oh, how do you say?

205
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:39,194
- The seat of the house?
- I love how you say that.

206
00:19:40,195 --> 00:19:43,565
- Hearthquake.
- You are making a joke.

207
00:19:43,565 --> 00:19:46,068
No. No, i'm sorry.

208
00:19:46,068 --> 00:19:48,070
Go ahead.

209
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:51,707
Fondamenta.
You understand?
Fondamenta.

210
00:19:51,707 --> 00:19:53,825
- Foundation.
- Foundation, si.

211
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:56,828
Foundation was cracked,
and he repaired the stone.

212
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:59,831
My grandfather was a stone
mason. He was avellinese,
him and his brother.

213
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:04,336
Tony, you should visit
avellino if your family
come from there.

214
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:08,840
There isn't too much left
because of the many
hearthquake.

215
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:14,346
But from the 17th century
is still there
a beautiful palazzo,

216
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:16,348
palazza della donna.

217
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:20,352
And there is a place in
the corner of the piazza...

218
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:23,855
is a wine bar
you can sit.

219
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:27,359
You can see the hills.
And when it's spring,

220
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:31,747
you can smell
the blossoms
from the lemon tree.

221
00:20:31,747 --> 00:20:34,249
And there is a church
with a bell.

222
00:20:34,249 --> 00:20:37,753
And they say,
when it rings,

223
00:20:37,753 --> 00:20:40,255
that means
that the baby...

224
00:20:40,255 --> 00:20:44,259
was conceived
in the town.

225
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,162
Tony?

226
00:21:22,164 --> 00:21:26,168
Tony?
Are you on medication?

227
00:21:26,168 --> 00:21:30,055
No. No.

228
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:39,181
Tell me more about your,
uh-- your dental studies.

229
00:21:41,183 --> 00:21:44,686
I was interested mainly
in tumors...

230
00:21:44,686 --> 00:21:47,439
of the gum and
soft tissue of the mouth.

231
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:49,941
Yeah?

232
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:53,945
Tumors of the gum, huh? Wow.

233
00:21:54,196 --> 00:21:56,198
Dad, we're eating!

234
00:22:00,202 --> 00:22:02,204
Hold it, ma. Anthony.

235
00:22:02,704 --> 00:22:05,707
- What does a gentleman
do for a lady?
- In his own house?

236
00:22:05,707 --> 00:22:08,710
A young lady's invited anthony
to his very first formal, ma.

237
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:10,712
Well, then.

238
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,722
Okay?

239
00:22:20,722 --> 00:22:23,225
Thank you, young man.

240
00:22:26,228 --> 00:22:28,730
Okay.

241
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:30,866
Tony!

242
00:22:32,734 --> 00:22:36,121
Honey, i told you
that your mother
was coming for dinner.

243
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:42,127
Hi, ma.
Well, look who's
decided to join us.

244
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:44,629
And with that breath!

245
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:51,386
- You know, i don't really
need that right now, ma.
- Aren't we being sensitive?

246
00:22:51,386 --> 00:22:54,890
Meadow, can you take some
chicken and pass it, please?

247
00:22:56,391 --> 00:22:59,895
Where's uncle jun'?
He said
he wasn't feeling well.

248
00:22:59,895 --> 00:23:04,399
In its lifetime, the average
american chicken's feet
never even touch the ground?

249
00:23:04,399 --> 00:23:08,019
- That's dicked up.
- If i was that young lady...

250
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:10,522
and you came and took me
to that dance...

251
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:14,159
and used
that kind of talk,
i'd slap your face.

252
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,661
That's right, ma.
Thank you.

253
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:19,164
Well, the whole
world's gone crazy.

254
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:22,417
Some woman in pennsylvania,
she shot her three children...

255
00:23:22,417 --> 00:23:25,036
and set her house
on fire.
Here we go.

256
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:28,790
How come my son's
in a bathrobe?
Is he sick?

257
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:30,792
- He's fine.
- Dad, you're depressed.

258
00:23:30,792 --> 00:23:34,429
Depressed? My father
came to this country...

259
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:39,434
with 17 cents in his pocket,
and he never made a peep.
Ma.

260
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:41,686
What's he got
to be depressed about?

261
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:44,689
Nobody threwhim
into the glue factory...

262
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:47,692
and soldhishouse
out from underneath him.

263
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:52,197
Ma, we all agreed
we would sell your home.
I'm goin' back upstairs.

264
00:23:52,314 --> 00:23:56,818
I was making a joke.
Oh, i suppose it
would be better...

265
00:23:56,952 --> 00:23:58,954
if i never opened my mouth.

266
00:23:59,454 --> 00:24:02,207
Grandma, how can it be
a joke if you're crying?

267
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:04,209
Oh, i mean, this is
really the last time.

268
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:06,711
I am never coming back
to this house.

269
00:24:21,176 --> 00:24:24,179
What a day.
With this wind, huh?

270
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:26,681
Whatcha lookin' at?
Oh, nothin'.

271
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:40,579
Who's she?

272
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:44,082
Dental student
from italy.

273
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:46,084
You know her.

274
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:50,589
We had lunch.

275
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:52,591
Lunch?

276
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:57,596
You fucking piece of shit.

277
00:24:57,596 --> 00:25:01,099
Going out to dinner with you
is a distant memory for me,

278
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:04,603
but you have time
to take her to lunch?

279
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:07,606
You are sinking
this whole family
into your misery...

280
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:10,609
with your wallowing
and your complaining,

281
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:14,112
while i spoon- feed you
and bathe you.

282
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:18,617
All it takes is a half- inch
of another woman's thigh
to get your ass out of bed?

283
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:20,619
What am i,
a fucking idiot?

284
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:24,623
If i had an ounce
of self- respect,
i would cut your dick off!

285
00:25:32,714 --> 00:25:34,716
You know, i was there
last night for dinner.

286
00:25:35,217 --> 00:25:39,087
I couldn't go.
Those poor freakin' kids.

287
00:25:39,087 --> 00:25:41,089
Yeah, they barely have
a father now.

288
00:25:41,089 --> 00:25:43,091
You should see
the way he comes down
to the dinner table.

289
00:25:43,592 --> 00:25:46,845
- I don't wanna know.
- In his bathrobe
at 7:00 in the evening.

290
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:49,848
Some bargain.
That's all anyone should
have to pay for a movie.

291
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:53,735
My cousin cakey
after he had his lobotomy,
he looked exactly like my son.

292
00:25:54,236 --> 00:25:56,354
- Livia.
- Empty. A shell.

293
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:58,857
Better cakey had died
than go on living like that.

294
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:01,993
- That's what his own mother
always used to say.
- Don't talk about it anymore.

295
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:04,996
I don't wanna hear
about it anymore. Don't
talk about tony. It's done.

296
00:26:26,268 --> 00:26:28,770
Mr. Tony, ms. Carmela
said to tell you...

297
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:33,275
she went to new york
to buy a suit for a. J.

298
00:26:33,275 --> 00:26:35,777
Go away.
Okay.

299
00:26:35,777 --> 00:26:40,282
Ms. Carmela told me
to remind you of
your appointment.

300
00:27:10,312 --> 00:27:14,316
Hey, how
you doin', tony?
Pick six today?

301
00:27:14,316 --> 00:27:17,819
No, just an orange juice
and a racing form today.

302
00:27:23,325 --> 00:27:25,827
This wind, huh?
Yeah.

303
00:27:31,833 --> 00:27:34,336
Thanks. Take care.
Okay.

304
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:11,373
- You dead now, motherfucker!
-

305
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:18,129
aw, shit!

306
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:46,574
Oh, my god, daddy.
Where is he?
Please let me be all right.

307
00:28:46,574 --> 00:28:48,943
They didn't say anything
when they called?
No, they didn't.

308
00:28:50,445 --> 00:28:52,947
Oh, tony.
Oh, my god.
Look who's here.

309
00:28:52,947 --> 00:28:55,450
Oh, my god, tony.
Is he all right?

310
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:58,953
Jesus christ, tony.
Daddy, your ear's all bloody.
What'd they do to your ear?

311
00:28:59,454 --> 00:29:01,956
I'm just putting in
a few stitches
to create a nice closure.

312
00:29:01,956 --> 00:29:04,209
Oh, jesus,
we were so scared.

313
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:06,211
They almost killed you
for a stupid car.

314
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:08,713
Nobody told them about
the kind of gas mileage
that thing gets, huh, med?

315
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:13,351
It's not funny, dad.
What's the matter
with you?

316
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:15,970
Forget how to talk
'cause your old man
got banged up a little?

317
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:18,857
- No.
-
he's just frightened, tony.

318
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:22,360
The doctor needs
to finish up here, ma'am.

319
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:24,612
Come on, kids.
Let's give
the doctor some room.

320
00:29:25,113 --> 00:29:27,232
- Come on.
- See ya later.

321
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:32,237
Poor dad.
He'll be all right.

322
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:38,626
Christ.

323
00:29:38,626 --> 00:29:41,629
You people can't wait
until they finish
sewing my ear back on?

324
00:29:41,629 --> 00:29:43,631
Face it, tony.
One inch to the left...

325
00:29:43,631 --> 00:29:46,000
and you're down in a drawer
instead of talking to me.

326
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,002
Who's talkin' to you?

327
00:29:48,002 --> 00:29:50,889
- What's he doing here?
- Oh, agent harris
is just leaving.

328
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:54,509
We're offering
your husband full
immunity from prosecution...

329
00:29:54,509 --> 00:29:56,511
in return for any testimony
that he might give us.

330
00:29:56,511 --> 00:30:00,648
We relocate you and your family.
You'll be completely safe,
all of you.

331
00:30:00,648 --> 00:30:03,651
- Hey, don't talk to me wife.
- So he wouldn't have to go
to jail either?

332
00:30:04,152 --> 00:30:06,154
Carmela, ask this prick
if i'm even indicted.

333
00:30:06,654 --> 00:30:09,524
This assassination problem
is not gonna go away. I think
both of you realize that.

334
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:12,410
I told you
to stop talking to my wife.

335
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:15,530
- Carmela, wait outside.
- Kiss my ass, tony.

336
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:18,283
We're the only option
you have left, tony.

337
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:21,286
It's not safe for you anymore
in the streets or in jail.
This conversation is over.

338
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:25,673
- What do you know?
- He doesn't know anything.
It was a fuckin' carjacking.

339
00:30:25,673 --> 00:30:27,675
Now, get out!
You're upsetting
my wife!

340
00:30:27,675 --> 00:30:30,929
In case
you change your mind.

341
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:39,554
- You know he's right, tony.
- Nothin's gonna happen.

342
00:30:39,554 --> 00:30:41,940
Wake up, tony!
It already did!

343
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:48,813
- I took an oath, carmela.
- What are you, a kid
in a tree house?

344
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:51,199
Did you ever tell anybody
about me gonna see melfi?

345
00:30:51,199 --> 00:30:54,452
Is that why they tried
to kill you? Because
you're seeing a psychiatrist?

346
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:57,572
Look, what are you
talkin' about?
It was a carjacking.

347
00:30:57,572 --> 00:31:01,075
- At least have the decency
not to lie to me.
- What do you wanna do?

348
00:31:01,075 --> 00:31:05,079
You wanna move to utah?
Be mr. And mrs. Mike smith?

349
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:09,083
We could sell some
indian relics by the road,
maybe start a rattlesnake ranch.

350
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:13,471
This is our chance
to get out, tony.
We could start a whole new life.

351
00:31:13,721 --> 00:31:16,724
Have some mormons
over to dinner. Eat some
tomatoes that have no taste.

352
00:31:17,225 --> 00:31:19,727
You know what i want?
I want those kids
to have a father.

353
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:22,480
They got one.
This one. Me.

354
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:25,483
Tony soprano.
And all that comes with it.

355
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,986
Oh, you prick.

356
00:31:31,105 --> 00:31:33,107
Mmm. Good.

357
00:31:37,111 --> 00:31:41,366
Probably i can't go
to that dance now either.
God, self- involved much?

358
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:49,123
Hey, it's uncle silvio
and uncle paulie.
Hey, squirt.

359
00:31:49,123 --> 00:31:52,627
They shot my dad.
He's all right, though,
isn't he?

360
00:31:52,627 --> 00:31:57,131
Take more than a jamaican
bobsled team with cap guns
to stop your old man.

361
00:31:57,131 --> 00:31:59,133
Where is he?
With mom.

362
00:31:59,133 --> 00:32:01,135
All right.

363
00:32:08,142 --> 00:32:10,645
They look kinda weird.

364
00:32:14,649 --> 00:32:17,652
I don't believe
it was a carjacking.

365
00:32:23,658 --> 00:32:26,127
This afternoon in montclair,
anthony soprano,

366
00:32:26,127 --> 00:32:30,632
who allegedly holds the rank
of captain or higher in
the northern new jersey mafia,

367
00:32:30,632 --> 00:32:33,635
was wounded
in what the victim claims
was an attempted carjack,

368
00:32:34,135 --> 00:32:39,140
but sources in the f. B. I. Say
was a gangland execution
gone awry.

369
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:43,645
Soprano escaped
with minor wounds and was taken
to an undisclosed area hospital.

370
00:32:44,145 --> 00:32:47,265
However, one of his assailants,
william johnson
"petite" clayborn,

371
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:49,267
was fatally wounded
in the attack.

372
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:51,769
Continuing now with--

373
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:56,274
is this true?
Why, do you think
they made it up?

374
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:59,777
But how- how could
this happen?

375
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:02,780
I don't know.
I don't figure to know.

376
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,283
I feel like
i'm floatin' in space.

377
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:08,786
- He's gonna look
for who did this to him.
- Anthony? Of course he is.

378
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:12,290
- Livia, you understand
what's goin' on here?
- My son got shot.

379
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,792
- And he got away.
- What do we do now?

380
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:18,296
- What the fuck
do we do now, livia?
- We go see him.

381
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:24,302
- Tony?
- Of course! He's my only son.

382
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:27,805
Thanks, sweetheart.

383
00:33:28,056 --> 00:33:31,559
We could use some peppers
out here, huh, carm?
I'll get'em, dad.

384
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:34,062
Don't you have
like two hours
worth of homework to do?

385
00:33:34,062 --> 00:33:38,066
I can't help too?
Some fuckin' shit, huh?

386
00:33:38,066 --> 00:33:42,570
Tony!
Jesus fucking christ!
Oh!

387
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:44,822
Who do we blame
for the hat?

388
00:33:45,206 --> 00:33:47,709
I was down the shore
at tom's river on
denny najarian's boat.

389
00:33:47,709 --> 00:33:50,211
Two shooters.
And his piece
was under the seat.

390
00:33:50,211 --> 00:33:53,715
- Do you believe this guy?
- Nah, two girls from
the hood, that's all.

391
00:33:54,215 --> 00:33:57,585
- Do we know who they are yet?
- The live one took off
in a taurus.

392
00:33:59,087 --> 00:34:02,590
Taurus?
Yeah, moolies
in a new taurus.

393
00:34:03,091 --> 00:34:05,093
Doesn't exactly fit
the profile.

394
00:34:05,593 --> 00:34:07,595
Motherfuck!
What?

395
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:09,847
These guys
i had a beef with
at the newsstand.

396
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:12,350
You were there?
Not yesterday.
The day before.

397
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:15,353
The newsstand?
The one in montclair?

398
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:18,990
- Yeah, yeah. I was,
uh, in the neighborhood.
- What were you doing there?

399
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:21,993
- Uh, takin' my mother
to the doctor.
- Oh.

400
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:27,365
Hey, put it
right there, baby.

401
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:29,867
Thank you.

402
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:34,372
Ah, this husband
of yours, carmela.
How much we love him.

403
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:37,375
He's the best.
He's like a father to me.

404
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:42,380
Just make sure
nothin' happens to him.

405
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:46,884
- I'll get it. -

406
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:51,773
come on.

407
00:34:51,773 --> 00:34:56,277
All due respect,
ton', it had to be
your uncle, right?

408
00:34:56,277 --> 00:34:59,280
Well, why fuckin' now?

409
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,784
Maybe he found out.
Found out what?

410
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:05,787
That he's joe jerk- off,
not the boss.

411
00:35:05,787 --> 00:35:09,290
That you been runnin'
things behind his back.
Anthony!

412
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:11,292
Uncle jun'!

413
00:35:11,292 --> 00:35:13,911
Don't get up. I heard
your knee was fucked up.

414
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:16,414
Don't worry, ma.
I'm all right. Come here.

415
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:18,416
Your ear,
it's disfigured.
It's all right.

416
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:20,918
Hi.

417
00:35:21,302 --> 00:35:24,806
I got mikey palmice,
all my crew out there,

418
00:35:24,806 --> 00:35:26,557
crackin' heads
to find out
who did this.

419
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:30,061
When we're done with them,
they're gonna wish
they were never born.

420
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:34,565
- Tony?
- Look who it is.
Father intintola.

421
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:38,069
- I came as a friend.
How are you, tony?
- All right.

422
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:43,074
If you'd like
to speak privately,
we could kneel in prayer--

423
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:45,576
not right now.
Why don't you
grab a sandwich...

424
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:48,579
and we'll talk later.

425
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:52,083
- You're sleepin' over, right?
- Uh, can i get anybody
anything?

426
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:54,585
Sil, maybe
another sambuca.
Hey, i'll get it, carm.

427
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:57,088
I'll take a curacao
if you got it.
I'll buy him one too.

428
00:35:57,088 --> 00:35:59,340
No, that's all right.
No alcohol for me.

429
00:35:59,841 --> 00:36:01,592
Can he hear
through that ear?

430
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:05,963
Ma, sit down.
Here you go.
Have something to eat.

431
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:14,722
- Want some?
- Fuck it. I thought
for sure it was him.

432
00:36:14,722 --> 00:36:17,725
But there he is,
glasses and all.

433
00:36:19,227 --> 00:36:22,230
Don't eat capicollo, grandma.
It's nothin' but fat
and nitrates.

434
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:24,232
Capicollo.
Over here.

435
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:29,987
- Look at that face.
- Who is that?

436
00:36:29,987 --> 00:36:31,989
- Who?
- That girl.

437
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:35,993
- Who, meadow?
- Who is she?
Is that concetta?

438
00:36:35,993 --> 00:36:37,995
That's your granddaughter.
Meadow?

439
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:41,499
All right.
Don't get impatient.
I'm your mother.

440
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:45,753
Hey, grandma, did you hear?
Dad fought off two black guys.
One got shot in the head.

441
00:36:45,753 --> 00:36:48,256
Anthony, what time is it?
Why aren't you dressed
for the dance?

442
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:50,141
- I can't go.
- Why not?

443
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:53,644
- Don't you need me here?
- And disappoint the future
miss new jersey?

444
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:56,647
- Get outta here.
- Well, mom was going to drive
us. She can't now, right?

445
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:59,650
You're gonna go.

446
00:37:50,952 --> 00:37:52,954
I gotta know something.

447
00:37:53,454 --> 00:37:55,456
And i want the truth.

448
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,963
Did you ever tell anybody
about you and me?

449
00:38:04,465 --> 00:38:07,969
I may have
mentioned something
to my immediate family...

450
00:38:07,969 --> 00:38:09,971
that i had a patient
who was in some trouble...

451
00:38:09,971 --> 00:38:13,474
with all the stuff
we were hearing about
in the news.

452
00:38:14,475 --> 00:38:17,979
I never mentioned a name
or any other specifics...

453
00:38:17,979 --> 00:38:20,982
that could identify you
as that person.

454
00:38:33,995 --> 00:38:36,864
My son's.

455
00:38:39,867 --> 00:38:41,869
Does your family know?

456
00:38:44,372 --> 00:38:47,875
My mother's made a few comments.
But i don't see how she knows.

457
00:38:48,376 --> 00:38:49,877
And if she did--

458
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:57,635
hey, don't even go there
about the old lady.

459
00:39:00,388 --> 00:39:04,141
You should've seen her
at my house after what happened.
She was losin' her fuckin' mind.

460
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:08,529
How are you doing
with all of this?

461
00:39:13,034 --> 00:39:16,537
Tell you the truth,
i feel pretty good.
Yeah.
Really?

462
00:39:16,537 --> 00:39:21,042
Well, that's good.
Talk about
a jolt to the system.

463
00:39:21,042 --> 00:39:24,045
Try gettin' shot at.
It'll give you
a nice kick start.

464
00:39:31,552 --> 00:39:35,056
You know,
when i was depressed,

465
00:39:35,556 --> 00:39:37,558
i said i didn't wanna live.

466
00:39:41,062 --> 00:39:44,065
Well, i'll tell you somethin'.

467
00:39:44,065 --> 00:39:46,567
I didn't wanna die.

468
00:39:47,068 --> 00:39:50,571
Every fuckin' particle
of my bein' was
fightin' to live.

469
00:39:56,577 --> 00:39:59,580
- I had lunch with that girl
next door, you know.
- You did?

470
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:01,582
Isabella.

471
00:40:04,585 --> 00:40:08,089
She was tellin' me
about the avellino,

472
00:40:08,589 --> 00:40:10,591
where my--
where my people are from.

473
00:40:10,591 --> 00:40:12,593
It sounded nice.

474
00:40:12,593 --> 00:40:16,097
Anyway, she was talkin',
and, uh,

475
00:40:16,097 --> 00:40:18,599
all of a sudden--

476
00:40:21,102 --> 00:40:23,104
you know, uh,

477
00:40:23,104 --> 00:40:28,109
we went
to another place,
like, in my mind's eye.

478
00:40:28,109 --> 00:40:33,614
I don't know.
We went back in time
to like 1907 or somethin'.

479
00:40:35,616 --> 00:40:38,619
And we were in this room,
you know.

480
00:40:40,621 --> 00:40:43,124
And she had this baby.
She was holdin' it, you know.

481
00:40:43,624 --> 00:40:45,126
On her breast,
she was nursin' it.

482
00:40:45,626 --> 00:40:47,628
She was whisperin'
to it, like,

483
00:40:47,628 --> 00:40:53,134
"it's okay, little baby.
Don't cry. It's gonna
be okay. I love you."

484
00:40:56,137 --> 00:41:00,641
- Did the baby have a name?
- She was calling it antonio.

485
00:41:02,643 --> 00:41:07,148
Anthony, your fantasy.
That's-- that's you,
that little baby.

486
00:41:07,148 --> 00:41:11,152
And isabella.
That she was nursingyou.

487
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:22,663
Oh, fuck me.

488
00:42:02,203 --> 00:42:04,705
You think
this is a stretch?

489
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:21,222
Hey, can we get
some of that whiskey?

490
00:42:28,596 --> 00:42:31,098
Livia.
You don't knock?

491
00:42:31,098 --> 00:42:34,735
- I could've been in the nude.
- What the hell is going on?

492
00:42:34,735 --> 00:42:38,105
- Look and see
if my slipper is over there.
- Fuck your slipper!

493
00:42:38,105 --> 00:42:40,608
I don't like that talk.

494
00:42:40,608 --> 00:42:44,995
Was was that bullshit
yesterday? You don't even
recognize your granddaughter?

495
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:51,502
Well, i-- i've-- i've been
forgetting things lately.

496
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:56,507
You'll-- you'll find
that it'll happen
to you soon too.

497
00:42:56,507 --> 00:43:01,011
That's terrific timing.
Right after the move on your son
goes in the toilet.

498
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:03,514
I don't know
what you're talking about.

499
00:43:15,643 --> 00:43:19,146
Hey, cooze. Cooze.

500
00:43:21,148 --> 00:43:23,150
How was bermuda?

501
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:26,153
Jeannie, she wrecked up
her motorbike.
She hurt her ankle pretty bad.

502
00:43:26,153 --> 00:43:28,155
Oh, yeah?
I'm sorry.
Yeah. Thanks.

503
00:43:28,155 --> 00:43:31,158
So where's your...
dental student?

504
00:43:31,158 --> 00:43:33,160
Where's my what?

505
00:43:33,661 --> 00:43:36,046
Isabella.
I haven't seen her
in a couple of days.

506
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:39,049
Come on.
Your houseguest. Isabella.

507
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:43,053
Dark hair, beautiful.

508
00:43:43,053 --> 00:43:47,558
- You don't know what the fuck
i'm talkin' about, do you?
- I got no idea.

509
00:43:48,058 --> 00:43:52,062
You didn't have
an italian girl--
she's here studying the--

510
00:43:52,313 --> 00:43:56,066
we had skippy palumbo from
down the street come into the
house to take care of the dog.

511
00:43:58,068 --> 00:44:00,571
Never mind. Forget it.

512
00:44:00,571 --> 00:44:04,074
It's a joke.
I'll talk to you later.

513
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:06,577
All right.

514
00:44:14,084 --> 00:44:17,087
You sure about this?
You're not pulling
my leg?

515
00:44:17,087 --> 00:44:20,591
What am i, an idiot?
Of course i'm sure.

516
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:23,093
You never--
no.

517
00:44:23,093 --> 00:44:25,095
Frankly, i think
i've said enough about it.

518
00:44:25,095 --> 00:44:28,098
I never threatened
to cut your dick off.

519
00:44:40,527 --> 00:44:42,529
Hello?
Yeah, it's your patient.

520
00:44:42,896 --> 00:44:45,399
The one who's been
involved in a few things
in the news lately?

521
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:47,785
I gotta talk to you.
What's wrong?

522
00:44:47,785 --> 00:44:51,288
There was no isabella.
What?

523
00:44:51,288 --> 00:44:54,792
There was no isabella.
I just talked to cusamano.

524
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:57,294
Him and the whosits
just got back
from bermuda.

525
00:44:57,795 --> 00:45:00,297
I asked him,"where's
the dental exchange student
that's stayin' at your house?"

526
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:03,917
- He looked at me
like i was fuckin'pazzo.
- You said your wife saw her.

527
00:45:04,418 --> 00:45:08,055
- You both argued about it.
- Yeah, i asked her about that.

528
00:45:08,172 --> 00:45:10,174
And?
You thought
she was pissed then?

529
00:45:10,307 --> 00:45:13,310
You should see her now,
now that i told her the whole
thing was just a fantasy.

530
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:17,815
- Discontinue the lithium.
- I already flushed it.

531
00:45:18,065 --> 00:45:22,436
Even if it was the medicine,
this fantasy of yours
has meaning.

532
00:45:22,569 --> 00:45:27,574
You know, the issue
of mother and child,
the madonna.

533
00:45:27,574 --> 00:45:29,693
You didn't see this broad.

534
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:32,696
Did you ever flirt
or come on sexually
with isabella?

535
00:45:32,696 --> 00:45:35,082
No.
Why not?

536
00:45:35,082 --> 00:45:39,586
You said she was
very beautiful and voluptuous.
Another question.

537
00:45:39,586 --> 00:45:43,090
- Why now?
- What do you mean?

538
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:46,093
Why the need for the fantasy
of a loving, caring woman now?

539
00:45:48,595 --> 00:45:52,349
- I don't know.
- I think you should come in
so we could talk face- to- face.

540
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:55,352
- I can't right now.
- You know, your mother
is always...

541
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:58,222
talking about infanticide.

542
00:45:58,222 --> 00:46:00,224
Yeah, it's a sad situation
that goes on in the world.

543
00:46:00,607 --> 00:46:04,611
- Are you still feeling okay?
- I feel pretty good, actually.

544
00:46:04,611 --> 00:46:09,116
When i find out
who took a shot at me,
i'm gonna feel even better.
